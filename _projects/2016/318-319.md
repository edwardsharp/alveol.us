“The Reader” was a three-hour durational performance that presented the artistic research of Alexandre D’Angeli as he investigated the presence of the body in oral literature. For the performance, the artist designed a table that, instead of a top, had a large box that held 100 kilos of sand within which 20 books were buried. The diverse range of books contemplated romance, poetry, philosophy, and art. In the performance, the books were unearthed one by one by the performer, who then read aloud two-minute excerpts (timed with an hourglass) from each book.
