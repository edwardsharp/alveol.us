“Duty Free Ranger: Coronado in Queens” embodies, destabilizes, and satirizes colonialism via a performative public intervention. A fashionable yet delusional emissary of her majesty, Duty Free Ranger exists as a contemporary Coronado-inspired figure seeking the city of gold and a pony in Jamaica, Queens, NY. He asks for directions using very limited Spanish. Spontaneous exchanges inspire curiosity, awakening passersby on their day-to-day paths. The actions connect contemporary cultural expressions, i.e. fashion, with the USA’s violent colonialist history through an experience of walking, a pony, and asking strangers for help while seeking out a mythical place. The performative action was hosted by HERE IN JAMAICA, a project conceived by Nicolas Dumit Estevez Raful for No Longer Empty.
