“The Hazel (Pähkinä—Nöt—Nut)” was a tri-lingual site-specific sound work (Finnish, Swedish, English), with a duration of 11 to 12 minutes, consisting of three recorded monologues written and spoken by Annette Arlander “on behalf of” a hazel bush in the center of Pori. The performance could be accessed via a QR code placed in the hazel bush growing at the location N61*29.515,EO21*48.001. It was part of the Hidden Art environmental art exhibition in Pori, Finland (May 13–August 8, 2016).

“The Hazel” is the most recent in a series of talking trees that have appeared as sound installations or nonstop miniature audio plays in various contexts in Finland since 2003, originally via CD players hidden in the foliage, headphones hanging from the branches of the tree in question. This ongoing series of site-specific sound works created for particular trees and shrubs is loosely based on the old Irish beth-luis-nion (birch-rowan-ash) alphabet. So far the following trees have had their say: Birch, Rowan, Ash, Alder, Sycamore (2003); Oak, Sycamore, Linden, Pine, Spruce (2004); Willow (2006); Apple (2008); Hawthorn (2010); and Hazel (2016).
