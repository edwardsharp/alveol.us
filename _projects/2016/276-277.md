“Tip Your Artist” is an ongoing, social practice project that demonstrates that art IS work by encouraging people to give artists money if they like their art but aren’t going to buy it. In talking with people about the project, I learned that some people are shy about going up to the artist to give her an envelope. “TIP YOUR ARTIST PAPER AIRPLANE STATION” introduced the concept of giving tips to the artist via a paper airplane. Participants made a paper airplane on a school desk and then practiced throwing it at a tape mold sculpture of Martha Whittington, who is an artist that I admire. I taught people how to make the paper airplane, and then I showed them how you could be standing in a group at an art opening, nonchalantly throw a paper airplane, and then continue talking to your friends so the artist would not know who tipped them. It was fun for all.

A lot of people go to art openings for the party factor, but they don’t necessarily buy the art. I am trying to get people to give artists money to thank them for their work. Art IS work.
