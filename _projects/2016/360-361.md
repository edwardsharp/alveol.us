The conscious body transforming space.

A public performance triptych performed for ninety minutes, embodying simplicity, angularity, abstraction, subtlety, organization and economy of form.

Drawing on material, architecture, choreography and setting, “The tradition” creates a dialogue with the body as a sculptural object, arranged in public space.

Three women, at varying distances apart from each other, repeatedly re-shape their bodies to accommodate a wooden triangle, a rectangle and a circle, creating a choreographic pause in the public domain.

In a measured rhythm of motion and stillness, they re-define the positive and negative urban space, whilst constructing diverse awkward poses that they hold for several minutes each time.

Exploring ideas around compliance and restriction, these held, part suspended, unfulfilled narratives, prompt reflection on our ability to endure, and what the body chooses to hold onto, but rarely acts to change or resist.

How can minimal embodied materials and geometries speak out political and personal stories? Can the architectured body achieve a poetical dimension/form?
