“Body and Identity” comes from the process of recognizing the body as the core medium of reflection. The performance examines what the body has been through, what the body feels, and how deeply it feels. The performative action and visual representation of dripping wax down the body seeks to provoke the audience to consider the ways in which humans are perceived by their unique identity and how this develops into value—born instinctively and experienced personally.
