“Untitled (adrift)” is a site-specific performance art piece that debuted at the 2016 FLESH CRISIS: Performance Art Symposium. I have been working on a series of performances that focuses on gothic imagery, specifically vampires, which are used as a sign of difference and a threat to conformity. For “Untitled (adrift),” I hid a white candle, seven neon-colored plastic vampire teeth, three yards of sports mesh fabric, and a gold brick within my clothing. The sports mesh fabric had a repeating black and white image of myself falling from a previous performance. I revealed these objects as the performance progressed. The performance began with a single white candle burning held above my head, melting onto my arm, face, and clothing. The performance ended when I spat out all of the vampire teeth onto the floor.
