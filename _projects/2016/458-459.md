“The Moving Mountain” is a discursive platform where fiction, science, and autobiographical stories form a soundtrack for a theatrical tableau girded by dance and poetic visualization. For this project, Mason conducts one-on-one interviews with a range of individuals from leading academics in the sciences to politicians, clergy, and anonymous individuals who range from centenarians to toddlers. Pulling together disparate voices through recorded conversations interwoven with music and dance, a new platform for nonlinear storytelling proposes a living, breathing organism as a monument to a constantly adjusting contemporary civilization.
