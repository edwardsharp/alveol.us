“Gently Shakes Left” was performed with PerformanceKUNST, a one-day group art show featuring fifteen artists creating performances that risked failure and engaged with the audience and the space in a unique way.

During the work, I wandered around the space and introduced myself to attendees, offering only my left hand to shake. The work was quiet, subtle and informal, interested in rupturing normative social etiquette. The work ran for four hours, the full duration of the event.

“Gently Shakes Left” was not concerned with the wild or extreme, but investigated standardised behaviours through acute disruptions. I am curious how heavily I/we rely on the comfort of the normal, and how little room it leaves for deviance. I want to wedge open that tight space.
