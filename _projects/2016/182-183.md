Two divergent bodies were integrated in a process of finding a common weight. Man decreased, woman increased. The egos were gradually balanced and finally dissolved—the level of empowerment became mutual. This process occured against the established aesthetics of gender.

The two body masses combined equaled 60.5 kilograms. The value 60 links the bodies to a third object/mass—a scale supported by a pyramidal structure of equilateral triangles (60°). The scale was the instrument for levitation. A tension was created as the two bodies attempted to jointly levitate, to balance. This was counterpoised to the inherent sublime equilibrium of the natural landscape.

In the shelter of the forest, the arrangement of bodies and structures was integrated with the surroundings. The sea, with its blue horizon, converses with the horizon of the bodies in balance. The horizon of the sea is a shared horizon.
