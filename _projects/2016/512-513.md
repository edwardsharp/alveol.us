In this performance piece, I am against a cot upright on the wall. I allow the audience to confess their secrets to me and then bind me to the cot with rope, leaving their secrets tied to my body. Each rope is symbolic of the person who binds—a strand of them—a confession. By binding me, they release their own emotional burden.

DAY OF PERFORMANCE AUDIENCE ACTION INSTRUCTIONS:

Cut your piece of rope, a foot … a yard. And I allow you to tell me an unspoken secret… Use your rope to tie me—leaving your secret behind, bound to my body against this cot. Each rope is symbolic of the person who binds me. By binding me, you can let go … reprieved by the release of your own emotional burden.
