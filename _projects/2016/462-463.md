As a performance “Charm for Rebirth” created spaces for people to relax, remove themselves from the everyday, and make a boat. The boat-making refocused the relationship of the people to the place they were in, the port town of Ipswich. It allowed people to build a new relationship with the water facing them, the hands that they had to build with, and their own beings. Participants made boats from willow and tarred calico. Then we walked to the harbor-side singing. We carried a heavy rock painted silver, a heavy rock painted gold, and two branches of holly. Other participants carried the boats. When we got to the harbor we picked the holly and placed a leaf in our boat. We put the boats into the water and tied them to the rocks. We got into the water with the rocks, swam out, and dropped them, sinking the ships. The people who built the boats had become reborn, given space to start anew.
