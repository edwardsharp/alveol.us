I am interested in the process by which the complex American libido has given way to our cultureâ€™s mediatization. Furthermore, exploring how this reflects back onto our social and political dimension by controlling the mechanisms of our potential freedom and schizophrenic identity. I try to extend these drives and desire even further through poetry or humor to create a rupture in this system.

In this performance, I embark on road trips and use various American motifs as stages to highlight our specific cultural fiction. I am converting a dented Pontiac Grand Am into a Lamborghini with an air of desperation, complete with vertical doors, lights, and sound system. This will act as my vehicle in which I will explore facets of the American libido including food challenges, sports cars, natural wonders, celebrity/youth culture, and road trips as platforms for revelation. My costumes will include political, celebrity, and philosophical references. I perform as a displaced wanderlust protagonist, wandering through a fictional, broken cultural narrative.

This project is ongoing and will be shown at Artpace this summer.
