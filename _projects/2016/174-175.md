Developed as part of my residency at Maquis projects in Izmir, “Lokma Dogma” is part of a series of works I call WORDACTIONS. The works are proposed as an investigation of the processes involved in the creation of meaning and the relationship between memory  and identity.

In this specific performance, I offered lokma (a fried sweet bread) in memory of my father at the Salepçiog˘lu Mosque Square in Kameralti. Offering lokma is an Izmir tradition as a way to collectively pray for the departed. Lokma is given on the streets to anybody that wants it, in exchange for their prayers for whoever the pastries are being offered for.

‘ÇALIS, BABAN GIBI ESEK OLMA. / ÇALIS BABAN GIBI, ESEK OLMA.’

‘Work, don’t be a donkey like your father. / Work like your father, don’t be a donkey.’

Thanks to Ayça Telgeren, Ali Kemal Ertem, and Tom Keogh for all the help in developing “Lokma Dogma.”
