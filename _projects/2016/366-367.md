Same Time, Always Behind, an ongoing performance-for-video series, expresses the connective power between two individuals who reside kilometers apart. As a poetic gesture, I perform with collaborators living at least one time zone away to witness and document a sunset “together.” Performed within the same twenty four-hour duration, each participant documents their respective time zone’s sunset. Exploring the interplay between simultaneity and displacement, the documentation is later exhibited together in an attempt to conceptually bridge and compound time and space.

For this iteration, “Same Time, Always Behind: Toronto/Eindhoven (II),” I collaborated with the citizens of Eindhoven. While Dutch participants documented and submitted their sunset views, I live-streamed my Canadian sky on a project-dedicated website and on location at MU artspace, waiting for the sun to set six hours later in my region.

With more than 6000 km between the partnered cities, participants were encouraged to re-frame their experience and to remember that their local sunset view was not acting in isolation, but was rather a unique global unifier of collective human understanding.
