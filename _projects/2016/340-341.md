In the performance piece “Don’t Believe You Are Anything,” different elements worked as mental reflective surfaces. The use of elements in the piece was sparse and repetition played a significant role.

For the duration of the performance I repeated the gestures of dipping my hand into a bowl of blood and then hitting myself in the face and head. I did this standing on top of a 10m long painting canvas. The blood splattered over the canvas, the strength of the blows forming a painting. My physical reaction also became a part of the painting, as my legs buckled from under me. The art piece ended when the organizer gives the agreed sign of 30 minutes.
