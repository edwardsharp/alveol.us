For “4 Lines in 4 Directions,” I further activate items currently on exhibition in conjunction with the BRIC Biennial: Volume II exhibition. The work “4 Lines in 4 Directions” includes a fifteen-to-twenty minute performance in which I focus on being in good relations to place. Centered around the number four, this work moves through a combination of scored and unscored representational and abstract movement, visualities, and verbalizations that reference systems of structure and contemporary living. I ground my work in everyday materials and experiences; during my live performances, items displayed in the gallery acquire new meaning. “4 Lines in 4 Directions” is comprised of four wood pine planks and the following components, which I made custom, in industrial felt: a hand-cut, circular floral motif, a silhouette of me crouching holding a crown, and a pair of moccasins adorned with cutout thunderbirds.
