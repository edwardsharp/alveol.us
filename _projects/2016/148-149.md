The performance was a demonstration held on May 1, Worker’s Day, organized by the artist in the context of the tenth Central American Biennial. With the help of the workers’ union, street vendors, and volunteers, a brick banner was constructed of individual cement blocks that each represented a participant in the protest. The wall blocked traffic on one of the most important avenues in the center of San Salvador, and was created with the intention of keeping it standing until the participants knocked it down. The proposal originated from research conducted at the MUPI (Museum of Word and Image) and was specifically inspired by an archive of photographs of protests held during the Salvadoran Civil War. The protest used the predominant elements in the history of these marches to make a statement about the current political climate of the country.
