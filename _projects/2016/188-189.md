FLUXUS TOAST

Order a bunch of toast

Cut it into pieces

Pass it around

Give a toast

Eat them

Fluxus scores are often puns, a play on words in which a humorous effect is produced by using a word that suggests two or more meanings. In the score the homophone “toast” (bread slightly brown from heat) is pronounced the same as toast (a tribute) but they differ in meaning. I wrote this performance score to celebrate any Fluxus occasion with a ritual offering of bread (toast) and a tribute to the event (toast).

The performers sat in a circle led by Bibiana and Viv, who cut the toast. A plate full of cut toast was passed to each performer who chose a piece of the cut bread, said a toast in their own words, and ate the chosen toast. The performer then passed the plate to the person seated next to them, who repeated the process. The performance ended when the last person ate their toast.
