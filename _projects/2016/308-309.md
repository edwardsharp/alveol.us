“Slow Show FM” was a 45-minute poetical meditation of poetry, piano, and live radio broadcast performed by ORBITA—a creative collective of Russian speaking poets and artists.

During the performance, poets Artur Punte, Sergej Timofejev, Vladimir Svetlov, and Semjon Khanin read their poems while being accompanied by noises and sounds of different cities, randomly recorded through the radio while traveling in different cities of Europe. These sounds were transmitted in FM range and broadcasted by the show participants with portable radios. The poetry reading was completely integrated into the surrounding noises and sounded like part of the radio program. The performance developed a new quasi-poetry radio station. The sound score was supplemented by melodic live piano improvisation by Andrej Eigus along with a video/VJ set.
