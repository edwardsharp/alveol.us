Drawing from the symbolic unison of the suffragette women’s march for freedom, I premiered Legacy Fatale’s Army of Women during Grace Exhibition Space’s 21st century Suffragettes: International Performance Art by Women. Titled “The March of the Women,” the performance was named after the original anthem composed in 1910 with words by suffragist Cicely Hamilton, paying homage to and participating in the resurgence of intersectional actions in response to the socio-political climate in the US and the world over.

Exploring the question, Do we still need to keep marching?, the performance started with a demonstration parade on the streets of Bushwick outside the gallery space while singing the anthem and channeling the Legacy Fatale concepts of Freedom/Equality/Power/Disobey. Both a commemoration of the courage of women and a revivification of their patriotic spirit, the final performance took place within the gallery space with contemporary choreography in five musical acts utilizing a vocabulary of protest, democracy, and feminism, portraying an awakening from oppression to liberation.

Comprised of 20 female performers, my group strongly references the ancient nomadic Amazon Warriors Women from 500 BC. Representing a diversity of DNA, the Legacy Fatale performers come from a variety of backgrounds and origins: Indian, Colombian, Hungarian, Native American, German, African American, Mongolian, Arabic, Sarrazin, Danish, Norwegian, South American, Italian, Tunisian, Irish, British, Welsh, Belgian, French, Russian, Algerian, Pakistani, and Israeli. Standing against Western culture’s tendency to objectify women, “The March of the Women” embodied a strong and alive female spirit—fierce, unbridled, and borderless.
