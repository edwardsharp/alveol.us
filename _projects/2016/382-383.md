“Last Thought” was a collective performance installation that was designed for a public site in downtown Copenhagen. The performers intervened in the principle square of Nyhavn, a place full of tourists and other pedestrians.

Before the performance, the artists made 1,000 white paper boats. These boats were installed in the square, around a monument to missing sailors. The pedestrians were asked to take a boat and on it write their last thoughts before heading on a big journey. Afterwards each pedestrian installed a boat in the square.

The aim of the performance installation was to make visible the different perspectives on the experience of traveling. There were both positive and negative perspectives. The performance was part of the International Performance Art day’s celebration where artists from 300 countries made actions simultaneously.
