In “Rainha dos Raios” I recount the myth of Ogum—the god of war and iron of the Yoruba people of West Africa. The idea of the work is to convey orally the notion of the dispute between the feminine and the masculine through the African cultural matrix. In telling the myth to the public, I represent Iansã, the female orixá of the wind and the storms and the worship of the ancestors. The counting within the performance occurs in five cycles and with each short interval, I incorporate the elements of Iansã, whether in clothing or gestures.
