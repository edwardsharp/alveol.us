HUMAN TRASH DUMP (HTD) released fifteen digital bundles (trash bags) via BitTorrent, smelled the smoke, and evacuated to archive.org. HTD is a video label and a 24/7 landfill whose office is the video—a mass of cables and adaptors swarming around a performative live-feeding organ with a VHS slot and a bunch of lenses. HTD piles these trash bags into physical space using discarded TVs, VHS tapes, projectors, and DVD players to create new mountains of garbage which have the potential to overload a wall outlet.

“HUMAN TRASH DUMP” attempts to provide multiple access points to anyone/anything that comes in contact with these trash bags. As landfills continue to overflow and profiteers (public and private) ready their future garbage for production, HTD disseminates unknown potential within an ever-mutating and volatile world.

Data is stored in a dump, not a cloud.
