Manuel López, a.k.a. lolo hjtyu tuyuyu

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 10,000 people have died in the Mediterranean Sea since 2014 trying to reach Europe. “Displaced” is a durational performance in which I transport 70 kg of sand (equivalent to my bodyweight) across the Plaza de la Virgen in Valencia, Spain. I carry the sand, which I gathered from the beach of Valencia, with a teaspoon, moving small quantities over a period of ten hours. The action is carried out with a teaspoon, moving the sand in small quantities over a period of ten hours without interruption. During the course of the performance, a progressive loss of material occurs due to displacement. Migration is a process of loss. Through the ideas of duration and process, identity manifests, is diluted, and disappears. Only a body remains—a material in constant modulation.
