“Visiting Thahab” is a study of the Muslim femme’s presence as an object in contemporary, domestic, and foreign spaces. My intention was to explore the identity of a Muslim-American femme in the post-9/11 diaspora. I hid my figure with gold, a color traditionally associated with luxury and power/masculinity. Both the garment and its symbolism isolated me and created tension between me and my surroundings, raising the question of what it means to be assimilated in this day and age. This question holds a sense of urgency in this work, which is necessary when considering the current political climate and the rise of Islamophobia in the United States and worldwide.
