Poetry and sound poetry performance as part of the AfterMAF 2016 festival—I performed, deformed, and reformed recent texts and sounds in a free improvisation session with musicians and artists Billy Bob Beamer, Wilhelm Katastrof, and Heath Nevergold. The performance involved using text and vocal sounds not as ‘poetry’ accompanied by musicians, but as another voice in the musical/sound art context. A recording of the performance will be released in early 2017.
