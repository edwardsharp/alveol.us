“asphodelus\albus” was a site-specific performance drawing upon ideas of insignificance in a perpetually shifting digital landscape, and of the destructive capabilities of rampant consumerism, focusing particularly on our home state, Florida.

Materials used in the performance were the public last words of Christine Chubbuck—a Sarasota, FL news anchor who famously committed suicide live on air in 1974—and two Mickey Mouse caps. The words were printed on 515 sheets of paper; the caps were hung on fish hooks from the ceiling. The performance began with one of us balancing the pages on our feet while the other scattered them throughout the performance space. The caps were removed and worn; the pages were utilized in several actions: they were used to create a tablecloth, two pages were eaten (one by each of us), and the tablecloth was hung on the fishhooks and used as a backdrop to allow audience members to take Snapchat photos of us, then cut in half to resemble hanging meat. Finally, five loose pages and strips from the hanging chunks were transformed into manifestations of the Asphodelus albus (or “white asphodel”) plant and placed in the hallway leading out of the performance space.

The performance ended when we embraced, laced fingers, and walked through the hallway lined with asphodels together.
