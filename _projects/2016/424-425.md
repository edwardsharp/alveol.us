“A Transfiguration of Longing” was a durational piece during which the artist rapped a 10 oz stone against a wall for seven hours. The same weight and mass of a human heart, the stone slowly eroded the surface of the wall. Each rap signalled the passage of time; the rhythmic beating, mirrored to my heartbeat, transitioned from a simple sound of yearning into the destructive element of longing.
