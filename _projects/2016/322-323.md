In “Untitled or Clean Faggot” I explored compulsion and obsession as a ritual practice, pop music as mantra, and narcissism as a survival tactic for existing as a sad faggot in late-capitalist America through mundane action, photography and Butoh dance. I stripped to my underwear, washed my mouth out with soap, photographed my ‘clean’ face, then transmuted the pain of existing as a necessarily self-absorbed faggot through a Butoh-based dance to Ariana Grande’s “Into You.”
