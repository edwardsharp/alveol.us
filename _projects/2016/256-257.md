My studies on queer theory and experiences with samba schools in preparation for the World Cup revealed to me several situations of social and racial conflict, which led me to think about black identity and the history of the favelas, in a city idealized for tourism and bearing the slogan “wonderful city.” So I began to think of building the piece “Alice?” which could tug at the various social realities in Rio de Janeiro, and reveal the contrast and reversals of a problematic city system often overlooked as “wonderful.” The performance action consisted of walking the streets, in the slums, suburbs, and dumps, with a blue dress and white apron on (characteristic of the character Alice). This work raised several reactions from viewers, who most often responded with utterly racist speech, or homophobic mockery. The piece ultimately sought to pose various questions about body, behavior, social conflicts, and the position of black identity in colonial history.

decentralized, decolonizing, dystopic-marginal body
