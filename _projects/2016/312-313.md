“The Man-Eating” is about food. It’s a criticism of a way of eating, a food ignorance in a supercharged society, canned food empty of nutrients, and so many confusing diets that cause eating disorders.

The performer uses his body—his identity—to launch and rub food, tasting and devouring different types of food and creating moods like anxiety and/or pleasure, gluttony, happiness, and guilt.

This interest in the subject is born from his own experience discovering a new way of eating. It is a result of being more aware of the importance of what we eat for our health and the misinformation out there about this topic.

The performance was created and performed live online in the first Online Performance Art Festival: vimeo.com/181266183
