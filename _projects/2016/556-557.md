“Di su nombre” (“Say her name”) is a durational performance—one involving endurance and the participation of people in public space—that honors the names of victims of femicides in Perú that did not receive justice via the judicial system. I made a human-shaped figure on the floor with rope in the middle of the entrance of the art gallery. I then began to jump the rope. With each jump, the name of a victim was projected in the space. The piece lasted until my complete exhaustion, after which I invited the public to jump as well, in order to continue making visible the names of the victims. In the end I replaced the rope in its original, human shape.
