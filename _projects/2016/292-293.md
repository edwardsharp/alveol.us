‘Puta gorda’ (fat whore) is one of the most common ways to contemptuously address a woman in Spain. Ironically, in a context of desexualization and rejection of the fat female body, it is labeled ‘Puta’ (bitch). In México, this body is re-sexualized through the use of the term ‘Gordibuena’ (sexy-chubby). This word defines a unique profile of socially accepted fat females who are permissible to desire.

Proud of being a ‘fat woman’, I subverted the insult. As an exercise of memory, resilience  and mockery, it was tattooed on the inside of my mouth.
