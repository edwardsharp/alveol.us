A video of my performance “Face Liberty,” created in 2013 in Kolkata, was exhibited in From Document to Live, an exhibition dedicated to performance art.

In the context of the festival Up-On International Live Art Festival Beijing, curated by Zhou Bin, I decided to make a connection between this video and the performance—between the exhibition and live art; to go from documentation to live. I created this link by using the same material and same basic action as in the original video performance, but in different way. This parallel performance was created for the third edition of Performance Art Festival of Xian, curated by Xiang Xishi, with the support of WBI.

The action consisted of placing elastics around the face. Each time this was done the words “I want to tell you…” were spoken. When the face was covered, reaching almost the point of strangulation, I wrote “…” on a blackboard.

The performance questioned censorship and self-censorship, and was dedicated to all people who fight for freedom of expression.
