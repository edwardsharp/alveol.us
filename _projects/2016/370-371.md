The action originated in the myth of the Hydra: for every head cut off, two are regenerated in its place. The rhizomatic posture of the mythological monster created a weakness—it reached the point of no longer being able to endure its excessive quantity of heads, and it fell.

The body of the performer became fragile and heavy during the accumulation of modular elements and repetition of action. By attaching empty red balloons that came out of the tongue like a speech bubble, silent scream, or a flurry of monstrous fire, the exposed body began to cover itself with these symbols of silent speech. The outpouring soon became uncontrollable.
