For this performance, Devin and Chamberlin ceremoniously cleanse the space, and themselves, to prepare for their penetration. This action is symbolic of the artists’ relationship with each other and culture at large, as they use codes of male ear piercing to mark the queer body. In many ways, the performed action will be very short, just a few seconds of penetration, but the preparation for the action is of the utmost importance, as the mark left by these few seconds is permanent. Borrowing from religious and cultural ceremonies, Chamberlin and Devin will prepare for the performance by abstaining from alcohol for one month and reading important queer texts. They will ritualistically clean themselves during the first part of the action. After the action has been completed in the gallery space, Chamberlin and Devin will invite viewers to celebrate with them.

This penetration is about the many ways that we have penetrated each other’s lives and bodies. By marking our bodies through the penetration of our ears, we are visually marking the body as queer. It is through this, and the following actions, that we are creating a new queer wedding tradition.
