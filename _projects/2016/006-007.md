I have been photographing myself since 1982. If I fail to take a picture the film is advanced so a blank image is recorded, creating a visual calendar. The 2,500+ photographs include my body from head to toe, as well as some of my environment. For over three decades the photographs show, in fractions of a second, my body standing in an environment (mainly, I’m by myself but sometimes I’m with family and friends) in a straightforward manner for the camera. As time passes, births, deaths, celebrations, and bad days come and go; all the while, the American experience evolves.

“Weathering Time” is a personal archive which I am mining in order to address issues of the female body, the family snapshot, and loss. I am also interested in producing images that portray some of the experiences of my generation, and what is important to me on any given day. I have not worn political statements on my chest for many years. However, with the campaign and subsequent election of 45, I felt the need to update my wardrobe in 2016. While social change requires more than donning a t-shirt, expressing concerns in public helps keep the issues alive.
