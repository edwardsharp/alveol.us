Focusing specifically on the US/Mexico border, I interrogated the perception of borders as permanent structures and sites of division. Although tall, fortified steel walls are intended to divide the United States and Mexico, the border remains as much a place of exchange as it does a site of separation. Through na√Øve actions, I attempted to disrupt and subvert these structures that strive to isolate and de-humanize. Using performance and audience participation, and involving both hand made and manufactured consumer goods, I sought to expose a reality constructed of fabricated materials and ideologies as a means to reconcile the pervading sense of disconnection and recover moments of community. These gestures were essentially self-oriented and could not practically effect large-scale change, but they were nevertheless born of the sincere longing to make the world a better place.

This performance was part of my solo exhibition One Sunny Day After Another. I stood in front of the white wall for eight hours every Saturday while the show was up, and the entire performance was live-streamed on YouTube.
