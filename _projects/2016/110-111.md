Prejudice, fear, aggression, isolation, intolerance, nationalism, and manipulation are among a few of the epithets which characterize the spirit of the time. How does this affect our moods, personal lives, and direct interactions with strangers? Can we still hear each other without the mediation of tools and machines? Can we understand the original human way of communication? Can we find similarities between us and a stranger?

With a growing sense of confusion there is a need to ask: “What’s up?”

My performance “What’s Up?” was an attempt to create close encounters with strangers and listen to the voice of their interiority. During this long duration performance people gathered in the art space. I walked over to somebody to slide the receiver of my stethoscope under his shirt. Calmly, I listened to the rhythm of his heartbeat for a while. From time to time I decided to approach another chosen person in the room for the same purpose.
