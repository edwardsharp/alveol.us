Questioning the nature and politics of food, and whether white bread is even food, and simultaneously using white bread as a metaphor for white culture and particularly white fragility, I laid out in a rectangular grid the slices of fifteen loaves of white Wonder bread. For three hours, I invited all passers-by to get barefoot and “Tiptoe on the white bread” and “Experience the wonder.” Finally, the white bread was restacked and rolled into a log. I sat on the bread log and contemplated the experience with my pants around my ankles.

“White Bread” opened multiple doors of conversation from the sensorial experience of the bread under foot, to questions of what we call food and why, to broader questions of American whiteness and questioning why questioning whiteness often requires tiptoeing so as not to upset the fragility of that whiteness. Also of interest, there was the creation of a group impression, literally and figuratively.
