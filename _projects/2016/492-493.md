“Esto no está pagado” is about the sewing workshop spaces in underdeveloped countries. These spaces present awful conditions for workers; there is a high risk of accidents at work and workers are paid extremely low salaries. On the other side of the world, we wear clothes made by these people without even thinking about their situation or life conditions. In this performance I create paper birds for approximately one hour and then I invite people to permanently destroy all of my work—an act they are often very reticent to perform.

It is important to show people how easy it is to destroy a lifetime dedicated to work when you have not personally met the worker, and how difficult it is to destroy handmade work when you have witnessed the entire creation process.
