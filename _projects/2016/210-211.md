There is a feeling amongst remaining Marxists (quite possibly including Terry Eagleton) that if the theory worked out well, everything else would follow it as Marx said, “all history has been a history of the class struggle.” The “Work for Free Project” is a small addition to that struggle to go against the proclaimed system.

This performance piece was the embodiment of a difficult theory put into practice—that all persons should be allowed to own any artwork that they desire. This project was about giving any person an artwork that they desire, and it was the dialogue initiated by the participants that creates the piece. All persons could interact with the performer in the “Work For Free Project.” Any person could interact and participate in creating an artwork for free that they desire with the performer. The way in which this participation occurs was up to the audience. Art should reach everyone.
