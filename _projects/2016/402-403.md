In the performance “Glitter Priestess Mad Tea Party: Herbal Remedies to Soothe Anger & Anxiety” I am standing in the gallery for the duration of the opening while visitors drop by to make their own jars of lavender-infused honey to take home.

I make lavender and oatstraw tea that people can drink, and I explain the process and properties to them. These are herbs that are very soothing to the nervous system, and helpful with anxiety, depression, rage, and insomnia. I also distribute a list of the medicinal properties of the herbs for people to take home with them.

The idea is that with the current events of our political climate many of us are existing in a state of perpetual anger and/or anxiety and that we can feel empowered to take healing into our own hands.
