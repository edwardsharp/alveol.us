“Slideshow Fairytales” is a reimagining of storytime, the kind that people may have experienced in childhood, but with less artistic talent and more four-letter obscenities. It was in a moment of necessity that I created “Slideshow Fairytales” in order to pay off substantial gambling debts. While my heart was in the right place, the money was not, and I am now forced to live a life with only one-and-three-quarter kneecaps.

It’s rough.

Despite this, “Slideshow Fairytales” continues on with a noble mission: to scam you yahoos out of money so I can have reconstructive knee surgery.

Oh, also to make you laugh.

The first Slideshow Fairytale performed was the story of “William (the snowman).” It’s a tale of self-discovery, a journey through the metaphors, allegories and (something I’ve taken to calling) “metagories” of life, but with a twist. William is a snowman and he has a problem. By the end of the story, the audience will learn William’s fate and whether or not he was ever actually a snowman or if he even had a problem.
