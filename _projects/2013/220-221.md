“Do u wanna talk about it?” is a live performance.

In a private room, I am sitting in a chair with my mouth taped.

The audience members enter the room alone and sit in front of me.

I hand them headphones and they listen to two real stories of sexual violence from my childhood.

The live performance takes around four minutes.
