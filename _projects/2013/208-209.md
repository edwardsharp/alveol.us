“pasadena” was a trio I created for Kate Monson, Kori Wakamatsu and myself. The piece was performed in conjunction with Work To Do, an exhibition of women artists at the BYU Museum of Art. “pasadena” traveled down gallery steps, creating a kaleidoscope effect as the dancers become doubled and tripled and turned towards and away from the marble walls. The dancers wore white dresses and danced to a duet by Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand. The work was inspired by Trent Alvey’s “Wedding Dress,” which was on display and is a consideration of what the female dancing body can make visible in performance.
