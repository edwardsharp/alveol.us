“Sticky for December” is about the duration of time people remain in ones life and the give and take within a relationship. Whether it be someone major or minor, mentalities, physical characteristics and objects are absorbed, affect and stick with us. In this performance, my collaborator Rachel Hrbek enters the space and stands in front of a running air conditioner. Soon after, I pass her and proceed to lift and hold the air conditioner for as long as I can (approximately thirteen minutes). Lifting it higher as time passed, moving closer to Rachel, blowing her hair back, I struggle and readjust often to hold the machine. As I struggle, she struggles in witnessing my pain, showcasing our strengths. Themes of individuality and growth that are universal to all people present themselves.
