I started totally naked with a crochet hook and several balls of yarn. After making a sort of seat, I crocheted a similar hat and proceeded to attach the two together around my body. After building my womb-structure, I rested for a few minutes before stretching my way out of the womb, turning it into an evening gown. Then I got up and joined the after-party. The whole piece took about 5 hours.
