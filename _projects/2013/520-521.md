I climb into a big plastic bag until I’m totally inside. I move. My feet come out of the bag. I turn around and step through the room like an unborn chicken. A pair of slippers fall out of the bag. I walk again. I stop and emerge completely out of the bag with an inflatable unicorn on my head. I take out a party-horn and unroll it while watching the audience but without making any loud noises. Then, I take the cassette-player and press play: the refrain of “Only Girl” by Rihanna captures the whole space. After the refrain, I stop the song and tilt my head back while blowing the horn very loud.

My intention was to affect normal visual and perceptual mechanisms far away from their cultural coinages. I tried to open new aspects of simplicity and show their strange nuances in order to stimulate audience interpretations. I wanted to force the audience to exist between sensibility and eroticism, between having fun and watching “Art” and between the demanding song and its own naivety.
