Conceived as a public service announcement, “The Prince” follows a lonely prince and her struggles with potential, fantasy, and connection as she prepares to be special while never leaving her bedroom. Unfolding as an episodic parable, a trilogy of announcements, the show explores an intimate psychological landscape and draws from personal history, family mythology and queer/feminist history. With a DIY aesthetic and playful characters (including a villainous stomach), it is inspired by seminal educational television from the 1970’s and 80s like The Electric Company, the humor of Gilda Radner and Faerie Tale Theater.
