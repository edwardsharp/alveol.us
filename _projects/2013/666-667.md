“El Olentzero Farlopero” is a performance about the myths created by the the Basque nationalist party and used as substitutes for Christian Christmas myths. Instead of the three wise kings or three wise men, we get the mythical coal miner that, according to Basque tradition, comes to town late at night on the 24th of December to drop off presents for children. In some places he arrives later, for example in Ochagavía—Otsagabia on the 27th. He brings presents to the children that have behaved well and coal to the ones that have behaved badly. My “Olentzero Farlopero” brings cocaine (flour, right!) to every adult that comes and visits the installation. The image gets more and more distorted through the accumulation of cocaine (flour), the disguise of Olentzero, alcohol, homages to Al Pacino in Brian de Palma´s _Scarface_ and a series of other actions, until it becomes this huge mess that mixes the astonished laughter of the people passing by with the complete irony of it all.
