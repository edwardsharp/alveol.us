“Drafting Universes” is a process-based performance that also takes the form of an installation. Through repeated gestures that represent creation, explosion and removal, I scatter hundreds of tiny metal nuts over a floor grid. My grid implies a field of measurement that, when filled with metal “stars,” approximates the experience of looking at the night sky, amplified by the illusion of infinite space created by the surrounding mirrored walls. Through simultaneously clinical, absurd and evocative gestures, I consider the diligence, imagination and hubris of the scientific process as it tries to define the unknown. Sited in an art space located in a former garage, the piece emphasizes the personal vision, effort and ethos of experimentation that drives scientific discovery.
