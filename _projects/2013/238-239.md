Raspberry Fields is a brother/sister duo who perform sound compositions via the trills created by vibrations on the skin of the body induced by air pressure forced from the mouth, colloquially known as ‘raspberries.’

In composition, two chief acoustic variables govern the organically-produced sound: the degree of air pressure from the mouth and the combination of fat and muscle native to the applied area. From there, a multitude of electronic variables manipulate the sound via two microphones placed in various positions near the source of the vibration. These microphones are then run into a number of effect and loop pedals that transform the sound further, creating nearly endless variance in sonic output.

In live performance, we dress scantily in black attire with face masks, appropriating the occult and S&M-inspired visual aesthetic commonly associated with the acts of the noise, industrial and drone underground that flowered throughout the early-to-mid-1980s (and continues today).

“Let Me Take You Down Cuz I’m Going To” was first performed at The Ho_se in Brooklyn, NY and consisted of four separate compositions—two male-dominated and two female-dominated—totaling approximately 45 minutes.

In successfully producing layers of noise, we aim to embed ourselves sincerely within this niche of sound art while simultaneously subverting its prevailing character via the absurd nature commonly associated with ‘raspberry’ sound production.
