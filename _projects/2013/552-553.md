This piece came about of the experience of writing the most basic type of written communication, using symbols instead of words, and making those symbols visually have as much meaning as saying the full message or expressing it in person without words. When we are physically not with a person to contact them, it’s sometimes hard to express what we are feeling only by using words or speech and not our body language. Using the example XOXO (kisses and hugs), I wanted to make it as I was writing it; the body would feel the expression as I continued writing the phrase over and over again as I moved against, over, and under the desk.

The audience can either experience the piece through video or a possible future live performance. The video version has my entire body fill the frame to make as if I’m towering over a little space to enhance the innocent look of the piece. They wouldn’t know what was being written as I moved through the space for the duration of the performance. After the audience sees the phrase XOXO written over and over and at the very bottom of the paper; the performer writes ‘Happy Birthday’ during the calm state at the end of the piece, as that phrase is probably the most used when speaking to each other, even though we may not know each other very well.
