Porta Bandeira: a Brazilian Carnival character (a standard bearer) dressed as a woman, who carries a huge banner, leading the parade of a Samba School.

A flag: a symbol of nation-state, a specific cause, beliefs or ideologies.

With a white flag, some actions are performed on the internal and external space of the gallery. Before, alone on the sidewalk, I walk from one side to another, observing everything around me. I cross the street to reach the inner space of the gallery. There I stay, in complete silence, while the deafening sound of the Brazilian Carnival plays. I turn slowly, facing everyone. The music ends and I lay the flag pole on the ground, re-arrange the fabric and, to the audience, show some ways it can be used. Demonstrating it as a tablecloth, I put some food on and invite everyone to a picnic. We talk, we laugh together, we get to know each other’s names and the places we come from. Suddenly, in the midst of the gathering, I put on my shoes and stuff everything inside a small bag that I make with the flag fabric. I pick up the flag pole, tie up the bag, and leave.
