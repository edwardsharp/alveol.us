“Red, Pink, Black” was an ever-shifting landscape of moving female sculptures. The women, or colors, bled together and splashed apart, creating palpable tension. Their vulnerability and sexual power was presented up close, making the audience uncomfortable as viewers; they were held captive and left to analyze what it meant that THEY were to be one of only ten audience members exposed to this experience.

I created “Red, Pink, Black” in response to Mark Rothko’s multiform paintings, using costumes and bodies to explore the emotions of these colors. Each performance differed in the order of the events of the dance and the events themselves, just as these colors change their meanings to us every day, every hour.

We inhabited this strange room like ghosts who have never seen another space. We owned it…and it owned us.
