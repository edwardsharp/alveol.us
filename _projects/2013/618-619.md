“Fierce (Untitled)” is a performance in which I wore Abercrombie & Fitch graphic shirts and their cologne, called Fierce, every day for a year, beginning November 23, 2012 and ending November 22, 2013. I paired the shirts with more alternative “DIY” dress, i.e. vintage and thrift store apparel, loud prints, bright colors and black. This juxtaposition highlights the A&F shirts as a conscious wardrobe choice as opposed to a brand affiliation or lifestyle default. It also de-contextualizes the shirt and isolates the practice of branding so that it can transcend the specificity of A&F. This work is thereby an exploration of identity via branding and style.
