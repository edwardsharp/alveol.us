“Between Us” inverts the position of interior by publicly playing out private negotiations that normally exist within household space, moving the interior life of the home to the exterior.

Holding a paper house between us, my roommate and I traverse the busy uptown area of Athens, Ohio, walking just over one mile. Constructed from sheets of handmade paper stretched over a thin wooden frame, the house is fragile and of a size that makes it impossible to see each other while carrying it. On either side of the house is a cast paper impression of one of each of our arms, from hand to shoulder and bent into an L shape. By fitting our arms into these shallow impressions and applying gentle pressure, we hold the house between us as we navigate the changing terrain along our route. This shifting landscape and our physical differences require constant negotiation and communication to walk with home held safely between us.
