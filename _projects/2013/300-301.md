“Blue Collar//White Linen” is a series of portraits performed in a continuous loop within the vitrine of ROOMS Gallery. This performance acts as a sculpture or video on loop. I created a dance with 30 second pauses, which can be interpreted as portraits. The poses I present as portraits are inspired by the domestic action of folding laundry, while the fabric of Mexican _folklorico_ dancers inspire the choreography. These strenuous poses are a study in using the human physical condition as a variable within the duration of a performance installation/sculpture. Viewers can have either a “30 second look” at their leisure or they can watch the full seven minute dance.
