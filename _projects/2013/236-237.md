An estimated one million lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Veterans have served in the U.S. military, but their experiences are relatively unknown due to policies such as “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” (DADT). Two years following the repeal of DADT, “The Camouflage Closet” was released—a 45-minute documentary about LGBT Veterans’ experiences with PTSD, trauma and recovery. This film incorporates the firsthand perspectives of LGBT Veterans, who were provided with cameras, tools and training to create intimate video narratives—stories they were previously unable to tell.

The live performances of this film featured an original score by Andrew V. Ly, who worked with the Veterans and production team to create musical pieces in line with the “videovoice” process that kept creative agency in the hands of the Veteran participants. These performances also included presentations on LGBT Veteran mental health by Heliana Ramirez, LISW, as well as panel discussions with Veterans featured in the film.
