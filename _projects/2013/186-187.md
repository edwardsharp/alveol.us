This performance recreates the architectural blueprint of my Brooklyn apartment within a public space and invites passersby to cross the drawn boundaries. By sketching temporal and ephemeral borders that represent my private space, I question the very concept of borders, the tension between inside and outside, particularly within public space. For the first part of this project, I used a wearable device to draw my private architectural place. By using a white rock powder, I recreated my 500 square-foot one-bedroom apartment in various locations throughout NYC. Once the drawings were done, the public was invited to “visit,” entering, stepping in or passing through the marked outlines.
