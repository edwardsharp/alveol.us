“Seranata” was a performance as part of the Diff’rent Strokes: Small Paintings and Intimate Performances exhibition at Louis B. James Gallery in Manhattan. I created a mound of various vegetables, roughly 3’x3’, and placed a live black Rex rabbit atop the mound. Three members from the all-female mariachi band Flor de Toloache played a lively song, during which the audience, seated in a circle on the floor, watched the rabbit as she sniffed and occasionally munched on a bit of kale or carrot top. When the song ended, I gently pushed the rabbit and vegetable aside and brought forth a live pigeon. I exited the gallery and the audience could watch through the large windows looking out onto the street as I asked pedestrians if they would like to release a pigeon. Some refused, but eventually one person dressed in a business suit was handed the live pigeon and released it. The mariachi band began playing again and two more pigeons were brought from the vegetable mound to the sidewalk in order to be released by pedestrians. The entire performance lasted approximately fifteen minutes.
