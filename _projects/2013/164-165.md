In response to the felt sense of the sacred, we worked in consultation with a group of local people who relate to the weather and waters as sentient.

Materials were assembled in response to observations and interventions in forested areas within a three-day walk of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).

At the manhole nearest to the gallery, a written statement was read to the waters. Then we took turns creating an ember with a bow drill. After five or six failed attempts, we lit a tinder bundle and birch bark, which then ignited a candle. The candle was returned to a sculptural altar above the drain in the gallery floor.
