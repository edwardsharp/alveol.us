The performance addressed the excess use of plastic shopping bags by Australians (6 billion a year). If tied together, these bags would form a chain that is long enough to go around the world 37 times. Less than 1% of plastic bags used in Australia are reused, and the rest ends up in landfill or killing the marine life. In this piece, I was metaphorically pregnant with plastic (shopping bags) and crocheted large mandalas (representing our current cosmic climate of waste), which could float on the water, out of my tummy. The performance was referred to as mythical and fairytale-like.
