“Federal Reserve” questions the International Monetary System and the physicality and ephemeral existence of money in a capitalist system. Two artists, one from the United States (the seat of much power) and one from the Dominican Republic join forces to interrogate the systems surrounding currency.

First, the artist from the Dominican Republic ties his own neck to a live, walking calf. In the Masaai culture of Africa, cows are used as a form of exchange, especially as a dowry. The Dominican artist affixes Dominican currency to the United States flag. Then the United States artist ties herself to the cow and glues U.S. currency to the Dominican flag. Both artists walk with the cow to the front of the Presidential Bank, where they raise a (false) gold ingot over their heads. Both are wrapped in the adorned flags.
