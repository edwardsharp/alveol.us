TRAMAS contemporâneas collective / APARECIDA SILVA / MARIANA MAIA

Alienated from the body. Wandered excitedly and naked. Not belong to nature? Alienated shirts. Attached to inanimate everyday. The job. The shirt day-to-day. But then, a tree dressed. A log—anyone can have some humanity? Buttoned up to the collar trunks, branches, stems, among foliage. Button and button. A body closes over the other. Nature, jacketed, looks at me. I just see cover ups. Only when I am seen, every mystery is unveiled. About bodies.

“Bodied—The Riverbank Museum” occurred in Avenue Brazil, near the Viaduct Oscar Brito, Campo Grande, Brazil. In the middle of the night, in a place of difficult access, Tramas Group  held an installation. We dealt shirts and white fabrics in a patch of trees lit with green lights. The audience consisted of only sporadically passing vehicles on the road. A photo shoot was done during and after the performance. In our artistic proposal, the body aims to find a new meaning within the context of language and performance.
