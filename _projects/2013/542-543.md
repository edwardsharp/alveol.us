“Zawaj Al Khaleej (Gulf Marriage)” is a futuristic, hyper-glamorous and queer hybrid cultural rendition of an Arabian Gulf marriage ceremony. This performance-happening imagines, as described by CHOKRA, the “social practice of marriage in an effective dissolution of separatist gender customs and normalizing operatives.” As a multi-sensory spectacle incorporating neon pyromania, Technicolor lasers, brilliant pigments, aromatic spices and world music exotica, this dramatization of a Gulf wedding accelerates through performance dynamics that collapse concepts of masculine/feminine, bride/groom, modesty and hyperdrama.

Audience members were requested to wear white.
