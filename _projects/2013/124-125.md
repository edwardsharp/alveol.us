I drag a table to where the crowd is dense. I pound on the table for five minutes. I play a recording of the five-minute pounding and make common hand gestures.

The crowd always stands still. They fall silent and stay silent. They think I’m going to say or do something. I don’t.

One person said “Struggle Session” is an orphan demanding dessert. Another said it is a political speech with the words redacted. They are both correct.
