A free boxing match in three rounds for an indeterminate number of boxers.

No rules, but several constraints. Boxers must:

	– Wear a wedding dress and high heels (women and men)

	– Have their eyes perfectly blindfolded

	– Fight to exhaustion

Their performances evolve within the constraints of time and modest means. No technical prerequisites or specific know-hows are required. From this work ethic emerges an experience built essentially on time, space and feelings.

The creation of this action is done collectively in the political context of the reform of the law in favor of same-sex marriage.
