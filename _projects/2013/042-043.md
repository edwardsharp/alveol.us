The “Untitled (Street Performances)” series consists of interventions in public spaces that challenge hierarchies of power and control. This site-specific performance is a critique of Eli Broad’s new contemporary art museum in downtown Los Angeles, which is nearing completion.

My intervention involved scaling the construction site and scaffolding while marking my path with mason’s line, an architectural material used to site, level and plumb. By upending the grid through the line used to mark it and by re-inserting an individual artist’s presence into the foundational structure of the institution, the gesture demonstrates the agency of the artist and the art on which the collectors’, curators’ and museums’ power is based.
