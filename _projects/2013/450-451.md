“Jogging” in sport gyms or “shopping” in supermarkets have become usual activities in normal city life. The destination of a supermarket has checkout counters waiting for us just like a finishing line waits for joggers. Nowadays, counters with mechanical conveyor belts have become standard apparati in modern supermarkets. Customers can easily put their goods on the belt, which will help to transport them to cashiers. The rolling direction of a conveyor belt implies the destination of shopping. My performance, jogging in the opposite direction on the belt of checkout counters instead of on a treadmill, can be an alternative way to rethink our daily movement. I am always interested in how images and human bodies relate/reflect societies and thereby produce aesthetic power.
