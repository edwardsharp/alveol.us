“You’re Coming with Me” is an examination of friendship and its mechanics. For this durational performance, we took turns pulling one another throughout the space on a rug. This display of effort is representative of the support systems created in the social and internal facets of modern platonic relationships. As we made our way through the gallery, audience interaction was welcomed. We switched roles only to relieve one another when too exhausted to go on.

“You’re Coming With Me” evokes the shifts in the dynamics of strength that women experience throughout the course of their friendships with each other. The performance also reflects upon the importance of these relationships as support systems.
