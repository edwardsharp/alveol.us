“WONDER” is a solo dance that I created and performed as part of ISSUE Project Room’s Emerging Artists Commission program. The work featured sound by Carmine Covelli and lighting design by Natalie Robin. “WONDER” mined the depth of information and perceptual patterns that I have acquired through a lifetime of dance.

By pushing my body into new dimensions of exposure, I questioned the culture of facades embedded in everyday life. In a continuous cycle of costumes and personas, I explored archetypes and definitions of gender, identity and virtuosity. The dance, which happened in the round, was meant to engage the audience in a purposeful relationship with the performer in order to mutually explore seeing and being seen. “WONDER” was an invitation to witness a body in performance, to encounter a shared space where curiosity and possibility is laid bare. Without wonder our eyes are closed.
