“Black Notice” is the second part of a body of work where I deal with contemporary responses to prejudice in white Europe. I create my own freak show. In this twenty-minute performance, I play my white alter ego Bianca White; using black and white photographs of young black women from the 1800s, as well as gestures and song, I exaggerate exoticism to a point where it loses its romantic notions. I aggressively create a specific black experience and a specific white experience that become ridiculous. Collaborating with a drummer and a guitarist based in Amsterdam who play live, we recreate superficial impressions of the other, hoping the viewer will take notice.
