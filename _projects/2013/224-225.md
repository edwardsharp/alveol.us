“I Am Talking to You” is a sound piece and performance engaging and collaborating with Apple Inc.’s personal assistant and knowledge navigator, Siri. Constructed through a series of exchanges between its authors, the sound piece culls from a pool of responses and recommendations elicited from Siri over the course of several sessions of questioning the voice-activated program. The resulting sound poem is at once mechanical and personal, a call and response confounding the functionality of Siri’s preset responses, and the motivations of its users.

The performance of the work—involving a stripped down installation and presentation of a laptop as playing device and speakers—lays bare the technology’s performative activity through the removal of the human intervention on which Siri typically relies.
