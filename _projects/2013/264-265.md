“Here’s my heart in my hands” is a performance about those memories responsible for keeping us alive, like the blood running inside our bodies. It’s a very symbolic and poetic work, a raw exposure of my heart and also a solitary dance of a restless mind.

I created some little ice cube hearts using water and my own blood. The action took place while the hearts melted over my body.

Some days before this performance, I had an accident at home and got second degree burns on my hand and my foot. My heart and passion were greater than pain, however, and I was still able to perform this work.
