Meditating on tensions around the act of witnessing unique to the 21st century, “Mirror Stage” is a series of actions that create a fragmented experience of both the artist’s body and the collective body (the audience). Installed in a fallen Doric-style column constructed from trashcans, my body is seen through a sliver in the center of the column or from the openings on either side. Inside the column, I read passages from contemporary texts on body and media theory. I document this process through a series of looped videos, using video sharing technologies to create an experience intended to be witnessed through a variety of digital interfaces. The real-time audience is invited to follow a feed of these fragmented videos produced from inside the sculpture. However the audience chooses to engage with the work, they are never able to experience the piece in its entirety.
