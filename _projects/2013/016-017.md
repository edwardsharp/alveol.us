“The Lovely Immigrant” is a live action-intervention with a duration of two to five hours. In it, I respond to the specificities of the space I am situated in via “lurking” around the audience whilst wearing a partially vision-obstructing sculptural costume. The wearable sculpture is created from found objects, textiles and worn clothes and acts as a mask. With my identity obscured, I move slowly amongst the viewers, inventing my own choreography. Despite the obstacle of discomfort and reason for ridicule as provided by the costume, I attempt to connect and simultaneously blend in via touch and proximity. Inevitably and continuously failing to “belong,” I eventually become a highly noticeable, yet invisible entity, a present, available, yet absurdly detached alien-being.
