A performance art piece about an old forgotten farm out in the swamp land. A beautiful scarecrow covered in eyes, and the giver of life, a gardener who has been overgrown by ivy. Together, they are trying to raise a bundle of sheep. However, the soil is hard to tend to, the harvest is hard to care for and the swamp monster is never happy. The swamp monster sends out her chupacabraâ€™s minions to catch her something good to eat. A battle ensues! A live band of hooded animals accompanying with eerie sounds. Also, larger-than-life characters and sculptures that come with quite a twist.
