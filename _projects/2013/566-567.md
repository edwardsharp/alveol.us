Pinina Flanders is a performance laboratory created by Yecid Calderón (Colombian philosopher, performer and activist) in which actions related to sexual diversity emphasize the bizarre orientations that can be constructed from the arbitrariness of the gender binary. With “The Host,” Pinina becomes the man/woman who welcomes the public and presents the artists participating in the International Festival of Performance-Extra. During the three day festival, Pinina used various costumes that emphasized the dual arbitrary aspect of gender, always showing her/his legs, his/her hairy body and his/her cheap chic. At the end of the festival, Pinina made a short speech about the convenience of living with the privileged markers of hetero-patriarchal society: being a heterosexual, white and successful man. Similarly, he/she tries to show that the performance does not require being at the epicenter of the event, but on the outskirts, on the edge, that is, in those places that blur performance art and engage in a kind of activism. The performer acts as a politician whose military posture is levied toward the recognition of so-called sexual minorities.
