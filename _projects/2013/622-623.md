Rihanna’s “Umbrella,” chopped and screwed, repeating slowly, rhythmically. Two figures: a man and a woman, both with black hose over their faces. The woman holds the man’s hose beneath her pump, he struggles against her footing. She beats his bare back with a belt in time with the music. Theater of cruelty is manifest: the two become a machine of pain and unrelenting action against flesh. Pop turned to horror. The torture is oddly erotic.
