“Red Tide Rising (RTR)” is a street performance from the Body Ecology (BE) Performance Ensemble centering around the experience of black women, sexuality and safety. Developed using materials from sexual education, love songs, personal experiences and interviews, “RTR” was created to incite on-site community discussion. Topics of exploration include pleasure, sex and sexuality, time travel and street harassment.
