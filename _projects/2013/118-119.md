In “What Are They Doing?,” I direct a group of performers through an event framework within which they are free to generate improvised content. The roles of the individual performers are interchangeable and they are uniformly dressed in wigs, underwear and sneakers. The events relate generally to situations of social anxiety and involve props from pop culture. I give the performers a range of options for how to enact each event and cultivate instincts with them rather than choreograph.
