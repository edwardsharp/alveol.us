“NIGHTMARES” situates itself between terror and comedy (the sublime), beneath the gaze of Henry Fuseli’s iconic painting and in the midst of an enveloping soundscape to plumb the extremities of our contemporary condition and posit the question: are we still capable of being overwhelmed?

Beginning at the birth of the modern sublime—the summer of 1816, when literary heavyweights Lord Byron, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Polidori convened on Lake Geneva to create their literary shapeshifters, namely Frankenstein’s Monster and the Vampyr—the performance takes on the overwhelming anxiety of confronting nature and ourselves in the 21st century, an era that seemingly reaches for zeros.

Having toured throughout the United States in 2013—from Brooklyn to Lawrence, KS to Albuquerque to Los Angeles back to Brooklyn and on to New Orleans—the show is recast in each locale under the helm of creators Adam R. Burnett and Jud Knudsen. To date there have been over 75 artists involved in the national tour.

The audience experiences the show as an immersive performance taking hold of all senses—from the wafts of growing sod installed on stage as a playing area to the interactive whiskey shots taken throughout to the beer and face paint swathed over performers: it is an experiential event that changes each time the production is mounted due to the ever-rotating company of disparate artists involved.

It’s also very funny.
