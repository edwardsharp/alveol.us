It was a sculptural poem performed with sunlight. I hung plexiglas, which I had sandblasted and etched with words and drawings, around a house so that, as the sun set on June 21st, the shadows of the words would rise and move into place on the house. There were approximately 20 installations, some sun-dependent, all location and time specific. Viewers were encouraged to wander throughout the night, view the stars and consider how words relate to the physical world.

A kickstarter campaign had been successfully mounted, and the rewards for contributors included hand-made books, photographic books and pieces of the sculpture, and some of these pieces are still available as documentation, souvenir and/or art.
