Working with natural processes is the most sustainable approach.

—The National Trust

The durational live performance “Rauka Painting” occurred during a four hour period between bright daylight and sunset. It was performed on a Rauka Stone beach. Raukar, or stacks, are a geological landform consisting of a steep column of rock formed by erosion.

Wearing a green and silver/gray evening dress, I collect water from the sea in a bucket, then, with brushes, I paint the Rauka with the seawater. Now and again I sing the song “Jag ska måla hela världen lill a mamma.”

The song title, translated: “I will paint the whole world mother dearest.”

The performance marked the end of my residential stay at Bergmangårdarna on Fårö, Sweden.
