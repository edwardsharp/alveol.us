This performance is based on the 1960 student sit-ins led by Lonnie King. WonderRoot worked with mixed media artist William Schweigert and his body of work that combines re-imagined audio pieces and distorted photographs both of which are based on historic civil rights events. For “Civil Sound Ecology,” William Schweigert, using audio and image, re-imagined the sit-ins by the Committee on Appeal to Human Rights and the 1960 speech given by Lonnie King addressing the Georgia State NAACP. WonderRoot created a pamphlet from the historic material that contained information on the overall project as well as a QR code so that viewers could listen to the audio.
