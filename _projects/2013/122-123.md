Several Fluxus scores were performed at the Roanoke Marginal Arts Festival in Roanoke, Virginia during March of 2013. My score, titled “FluXus Direction,” was performed by C. Mehrl Bennett of Columbus, Ohio USA.

My score:

Draw an X on the floor or ground (hint: chalk, tape, papers or other items can be used)

Step into one blank section

Stand in opposition to the X’s direction while in the blank section

Step into the next blank section

Stand in opposition to the direction this section faces

Repeat until all blank sections have been stepped into

I wrote this score as an exploration of direction and how we interpret North, South, East and West. Do we flow into or out of these directions? How do we imagine a line or space to demarcate direction? As is typical of Fluxus scores, the score is written with a lot of room for performer interpretation. In this performance the performer incorporated the natural “X” created by a 4-way street corner crossing, walking from one corner to another as she executed the score.
