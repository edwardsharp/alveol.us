In “Sushi,” the artist is shown eating an avocado roll off of her performance partner’s naked body as he lays motionless on the ground. This performance is an analysis of the fetishization of culturally appropriated past times and of the idea of what it means to be “cultured” in Western society. The disconnect the artist emulates correlates to the detachment present in one’s decision to appropriate the rituals of other cultures, while at the same time questioning the intimacy or lack of intimacy present in the modern relationship.
