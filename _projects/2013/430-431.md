I reached patiently into the silence with my whole being and I heard the future. Subsequently, I offered a piece in two parts, both a performance and a small cluster of text-based objects. The objects were four t-shirts upon which the text of my vision for the future was printed. These objects were presented in, or to, the space for exhibition in a short and sweet five-minute performance.

The performance had a super clean aesthetic and was composed of a series of task-based actions. I stood in the space with a spinning globe lamp. I had a microphone and a small looping device. I began wearing all four of my t-shirts. I took them off, one by one, each time revealing the next phrase of my prophecy. I invited a member (or members) of the audience to read the text of each t-shirt into the microphone. Each phrase was then looped and layered over the next, creating a sweetly sinister, short-lived wall of prophetic sound.

The prophecy read as follows:

“I foresee a world in which I believe…”

“Survival demands that irony is not enough”

“And the pursuit of beauty becomes the greatest risk you can take”

“And we will drown together in a wild, wild sea of love”

The prophecy represents my warning, my idyll and the basis of my current practice.
