In “All is Moving,” I respond to the paintings of Jaune Quick-to-See Smith in the exhibit “Water and Air” by using common items that speak to our times, such as Skittles candy, a silver glove, emergency survival blankets and her signature wooden tokens. The piece also addresses the role that living process plays in performance art. The titles of the six paintings I respond to are, in order of appearance:

	1. Sissy and the Plutocrats (a female Sisyphus pushes her shopping cart up a mountain, which is laden with elegant foodstuffs)

	2. Imperialism

	3. Black Ice

	4. Shock and Awe

	5. Turtle Island

	6. Underwater
