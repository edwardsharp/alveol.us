“Rider Negotiation” was a performance in which I transported three suitcases filled with drywall from Chicago’s Slow Gallery to my studio. My practice has become as much about performative actions as it is about documentation. Rather than documentation looking like documentation, the work carries on through pieces and parts from previous works and folds in on itself.

“Rider Negotiation” was derived from two works I did at Slow, “Hole for Shaking Hands” in 2012 and “Produced by, Hole For Shaking Hands” in 2013. In “Hole for Shaking Hands,” I cut a hole in a wall that viewers could shake hands through. In 2013, I wanted to expose the documentation from that last work, so I created “Produced by, Hole For Shaking Hands,” where I stripped the wall down, except for the section where the hole had been, and then packed the drywall into suitcases. During the exhibition, I activated “Rider Negotiation,” where I donned a Tyvek suit that I had left hanging in the gallery and then took the suitcases to my studio.

In the future I plan to repeat “Rider Negotiation” when I take the suitcases on a trip to make another wall.
