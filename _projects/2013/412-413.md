“Flouring/Flowering” is a durational performance wherein I toss colored flour into the air (a la the Indian festival of Holi) and let it fall on me, coating my body. The piece grew out of a place of wanting to expose my middle-aged, very ordinary body and put it in a context where it would be surrounded by the aura of the colored flour, framing it with this ephemeral beauty. As the flour coated my body, it highlighted both things that are culturally considered beautiful and things considered imperfect. The flour changed the landscape of my body, thereby creating a fresh view of what might not otherwise be noticed. By extrapolation, I hoped viewers might reflect on and appreciate their own bodies as well. The setting was an old warehouse elevator, no longer functional and dark, with small lights attached to the walls. The lights also created shadows on my body while highlighting the colored flour in the air.
