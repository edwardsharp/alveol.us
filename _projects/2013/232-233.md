…she stayed anxiously beside the door and started to weep…

On November 3rd, 1879, after failed attempts on rabbits, Gerhard Armauer Hansen, poised along a knife’s edge, relocated leprosy bactillum to the eye of a protesting female. The contamination caused an ocular leprosy node to develop. With respect and sorrow, on the same site of Bergen’s Lepramuseet, I introduce a foreign body to my eyes—artificial tears. The intrusion bites the membranes and stirs authentic drops, the hand reaches out…

“Xenograftie (Artificial Sorrow)” investigates the borders of ethics and the _animot_—the cultural alignment between the animal and the female. The audience witness an act of memorialisation: the fur of a slaughtered rabbit and my own severed hair gradually cling to the body of the other, translating the languages into which they are written.
