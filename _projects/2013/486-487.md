“Reasons for Licking” is a performance exercise to address anxiety that had become increasingly debilitating in my life. The performance consists of me repeatedly licking a small cafe window during regular business hours. The piece has an unlimited time frame and can be seen as an exercise to be performed when great anxiety arises and needs expression. The duration of the piece addresses the line between excitement, boredom and intimacy found in public spectacle. The cycle of nervousness mimics a dog’s need to endlessly lick a wound. It is a meditation on shame, humor, sexuality and acceptance. By performing an absurd and endless act of public licking, my anxieties were unburdened to the crowd and also given personal ownership.
