The performance “500X” was based on the frequency of two stepping feet. Every fourth steps follows the flipping of one of 500 pages of an empty book. This action is accompanied by an inhale on every right page and an exhale on every left page. Each page has half of a breath and four footsteps, totaling 500 in- and exhales and 2,000 footsteps. “500X” is the audio-visual fragment of a singular organism’s life-rhythm. Niklaus Mettler performed this phenomenon, extending an external pattern into his entire body. The breathing developed and synchronized into a bass rhythm for the electronic sounds played by the musician and composer Gunnar Gunnsteinsson. In the performance, the book functions as the score and the body as pacemaker, while the sounds fuse and create an analog and digital ambience. With these 500X (43 minutes), it is the intention to accommodate a physical experience of time for the performer and the viewer. Viewers witness a balance between the feel of an exalted club-music scene and the painful performance-monitoring of an athlete.
