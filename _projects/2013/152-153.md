GABRIELLE SINCICH, AMANDA MOYER NéE ROGERS, BRENDA OELBAUM

This was one of a series of performative art pieces that I put together as part of my Venus of Willendorf Project. This was presented at a Theater and Performance Art Symposium of IU where most of the other participants were theater-based. It was well received and the message was important, symbolic and metaphorical. It had a very strong 1970’s Feminist vibe, very organic and less rehearsed than the theater that most of the attendees were involved with.

Description:

Three Players: Fat Woman (Nude), Dresser, Mirror (Player holding Mirror)

Dresser assists Fat Woman in applying pages of a Diet Book to her body using papier mâché in a literal and physical attempt to transform herself. The Dresser is always positive, the Mirror is always critical.

As the Fat Woman is being covered with the papier mâché, each player will take turns approaching the Audience: Fat Woman for outside opinions, Dresser for agreement and finally the Mirror, allowing the viewers to see themselves. Do they judge themselves? Are they judging others and how they look? How does it feel to have the critical eye turned on them?

Duration: half hour to one hour (variable)
