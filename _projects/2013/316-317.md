This series investigates concepts of corporate management systems, prison establishments, sisyphean tasks, and surveillance systems by decontextualizing familiar tasks and placing them in natural settings. In this piece, I perform in a business suit sitting on a white chair that contrasts the surrounding coastal environment. I hold a ream of paper on my lap and slowly slide sheets of paper off the pile one at a time. It is a quiet gesture that can create a somewhat eerie or unsettling ambiance. The actions are further manipulated through the video to move forward and backward through time, exposing an absurdity and dry humor.
