A lecture performance on the statistical mythology of basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain. He was a lover and a fighter. On March 2, 1962 he scored 100 points in a single game—an NBA record that has stood for over 50 years. In 1992 he wrote an autobiography where he claimed that he had sex with 20,000 women. I read this book when I was 12 years old. I have wondered since about the relationship between these two numbers, and whether stats tell us the whole story.

On February 19, 2013 I performed a special edition of “A View From Above,” for an audience of one, at a Brooklyn Nets game.
