“You me he and the other” was a celebration of diversity and love. We painted the Chinese characters of Me and He on our chests and You and The Other on our backs. By turning, we could make different combinations, like The Other You or Me He. At a time when gay rights are under pressure, it is important to show autonomy, free choice and love. With bare, painted bodies, we walked hand in hand through the streets of Guangzhou, anxious if passers-by could read our calligraphy and how they would react. We caused a lot of excitement and loved the interaction with the public.
