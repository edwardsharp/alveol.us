“Dream I Tell You” is a trance-theater performance inspired by hallucinatory experiences in surreal locations.

Flickering through dream-narratives, “Dream I Tell You” explores and explodes archetypes of the unconscious in a psychedelic tone-poem. Audience members are offered milk and cookies at the bar before entering an immersive set and soundscape. Drawing heavily from the dislocation and nonlinearity of the work of Richard Foreman, images from dreams collide and bleed into each other, coalescing into dances and tableaus. Designed to create an experience of disorientation and hypnosis, “Dream I Tell You” is a trip. I adapted the performance’s text from dream journals recorded by varied sources, including the writers Georges Perec and Hélène Cixous (as well as my own dream journals) and the later novels of Brazilian visionary Clarice Lispector.
