“Zeitgeist” is an art lesson given in an art school. It is given both to the plaster figures inhabiting the school, as well as to the attendees, and it traverses, through selected texts, a journey from Greek art to contemporary art. It explains the use of plaster as sculptural material and of the body as “new” sculptural material. It paraphrases Paul Klee’s discussion of how art not only reproduces the visible, but makes it become visible.
