This piece was created in a response to the scrutiny of womenâ€™s bodies in the media, which has existed for many, many years, but seemed to reach a peak in 2013. I wanted to reveal the extremes that women can feel pushed to in terms of diet and exercise and how any method that lacks self-love and compassion will cause someone to implode.

The piece presents a character exercising in a private space. The character transitions into training, sitting in front of a plate of food and using pain to condition herself out of craving it. The exercise and the pain infliction increase until the piece reaches a peak, and the character binges on the food in front of her. She goes back to exercising, continuing the cycle.
