I made flowers of toilet paper at Praça da Liberdade (Freedom Square), at Belo Horizonte. To give color to my flowers, I used grape juice (purple), peach (yellow) and strawberry (pink).

In 2008, I was interned in the psychiatric hospital Santa Maria, at Belo Horizonte. For 28 days in hospital, I did not have many resources to produce my art. The alternative I found was to use the routine materials available inside the hospital for my work and one of them was the toilet paper. I made flowers of toilet paper from the bathroom of my room. I colored the flowers with the juices that I drank, and gave them to the other hospital patients. “Flores para Santa Maria (Flowers for Santa Maria)” is a resignification of that troubled period of my life. For this, I chose the Praça da Liberdade (Freedom Square), at Belo Horizonte/Minas Gerais, as scenery for the performance.
