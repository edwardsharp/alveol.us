The performance piece reflects on the predatory exploitation of natural resources along the São Francisco River.

This enormous river runs through all Brazilian territory and, alongside its margins, all one can see is an altered, scarred and upset landscape.

In the piece, the performer lays down inside a boat with only her legs out, having her face and body covered with tires, tire air tubes and garbage bags. The piece lasts between six to eight hours, uninterrupted.
