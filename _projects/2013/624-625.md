I show a video projection of  the super typhoon in Philippines that destroyed many places in Tacloban and led to the deaths of many people by flood.

Iâ€™m wearing a Stripewalker costume. I then put a plaster mask onto my face, symbolizing sympathy for the typhoon victims. I then destroy the mask using a high-powered sandblaster in order to create smoke and dust, forcing the audience to feel the discomfort of my countrymen trying to survive.
