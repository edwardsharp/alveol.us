The “Tactile Anacostia Workshop” series preserved the food stories of residents in Anacostia and neighboring Ward 8. After meetings and interviews with newcomers and long-time residents, specific eating activities were selected to exhibit, celebrate and digest some of the food anecdotes collected. These activities were made with ingredients foraged, purchased, grown and harvested from the vicinity.

Neighbors and passers-by were invited to create ephemeral edible art, finding other ways to taste, experience or perform with these Anacostia-grown stories that they have collectively preserved. Additional stories were collected during the workshops while sitting at a hand-crafted bench. These stories are slated for a future performative installation.

The three workshops (Chester Street Pickles / Beans & Blues / Southeast (Mul) Berry Jam) were presented as part of the Lumen8Anacostia Festival. The project was supported by the DC Commission on the Arts & Humanities.
