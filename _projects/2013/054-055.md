Created through free-association and by dictating the contents into a voice-to-text device, this stream of consciousness “novel,” with technological glitches intact, was “spoken” into the open air by a computer and other various devices in several cities around the United States, starting in the nation’s capital and ending in Boston, MA on the day of the Boston Marathon bombings.

The “novel” (as well as the manner in which it was created) addresses a world increasingly dominated by technology and the ramifications of continued immersion in this culture. The story follows the life of Phineas, a Cubicle Drone (or Droëæn) who lives in an underground civilization devoid of light and nature. Through a series of mishaps, he finds a path from the subtle mind-control of this dystopian future, ultimately joining a resistance force to escape back to the surface of the planet and livable breathable air and sunlight.

Subsequent “performance” of the “novel” should _not_ be read, but should be listened to via computer (or similar device), as this is the best way to submerge one’s consciousness into the patterns of the malfunctioning machinery.
