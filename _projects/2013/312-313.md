In an attempt to engage the public and to encourage them to communicate in a different and slower way, I collaged 1,500 original postcards to share. Iâ€™ve been making postcards to send to friends and family for 20 years. I wanted to share this experience with the younger generations that are ever dependent on instant communication. What would they write? How would the person receiving it feel? The postcards were placed in a tower that contained 120 slots. The tower was placed in the Atrium of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where I would engage the public and encourage them to take a postcard to share with a loved one. The diversity of the audience and their reactions were wide-ranging and led to many stimulating conversations. I encountered people from all seven continents and people of all ages, races and professions. The tower was put out nineteen times in the course of two months. I would stay with the tower two to four hours at a time. It was an amazing and rewarding experience!
