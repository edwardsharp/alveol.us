A performance, in collaboration with composer and musician Damon Lee, for a custom-built 40-foot electric guitar, projection and processed alto saxophone. Performed at the Sheldon Museum of Art in Lincoln, Nebraska.

The long-string guitar is made up of two pieces, a bridge/pickup end and a nut/tuner end, and built from aluminum extrusions to be completely adjustable and customizable. Using a single string, the guitar is capable of a surprising range of sounds from deep rhythmic thrumming, pitched drones with considerable harmonics and squealing high-pitched yelps. It is actuated by a variety of methods and tools, including plucking and rubbing with the fingers, bowing and using custom-built aluminum tools for scraping and otherwise modifying the pitch.
