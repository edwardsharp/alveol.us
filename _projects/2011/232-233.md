I used semaphore to share poetry with the public. Semaphore is a maritime-based communication system that uses handheld flags to relay information at a distance. 

Poetry, like any other art form, can be abstract and obscure. I deconstructed my own poetry and translated it into semaphore, thereby altering the audience’s experience. It became a visual study instead of an auditory affair. The audience was given a semaphore cheat sheet and was invited to fill in the poems as I flagged them.

This piece was made possible by 4Culture’s Site-Specific, Performance Network Program. It was performed at the Georgetown Carnival, Celebrate Des Moines, Smoke Farm, Nepo 5K and Fall City Days.
