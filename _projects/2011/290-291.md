Problem: joy in poetry, words made real, poetry rediscovering orality. 

Bobby Sanabria and Bob Holman’s poetry/music performance as Jesse Rickes projects poems onto building from POEMobile. Poets in Spanish/English, some translated, pop on building in morphing software. Apotheosis: “For Jorge Brandon” as storm clouds crept closer. Projections.
