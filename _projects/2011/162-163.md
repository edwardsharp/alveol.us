The dreams of Alexander von Humboldt, supernatural amalgamations of material floods, and circles of sidereal commotion. Imperfect approximations of the Universe as a Whole. Or a reverberatory system’s trajectory of the now and not now, if you will. 

As a collective the 181 is interested in creating performance situations out of the sample-merging and strangely hybridized “what ifs” of information transmissions and material demonstrations. At all times our performances are webcast, at all times the webcasts are simultaneously brought back into the performances (projected, reflected, infected). Feedback and looping layers of this, the permeable present. At the same time that we acknowledge our inability to comprehend what might constitute the boundaries of the present or past, we are committed to the task of describing what might have been and yet still be. All that the senses can but imperfectly comprehend. And always, ultimately, everything is an ode of one type or another.
