This performance deals with the constant reach of wanting to be in a safe place but also searching for comfort from a different place. The piece features a medium sized, half-inflated round pool-in which I lay down-containing orange paint, surrounded by light blue towels, and with a pile of feathers behind it. Throughout the piece, dressed in white colored pajamas, I reached back to the feathers continuously thrusting my waist as I struggle to reach back to collect a handful of them. Once I was able to, I reached back in, slowly cuddling the feathers for about 10-15 seconds, and place them in the pool. I continued to reach back until I feel that all of the feathers have been pulled out from the pile. Once that was done, I made a snow angel using the feathers surrounding me. It connects childhood and adulthood through my reaching back, in a masturbation-like stretching out, then resorting to a child-like fetal position holding the feathers desperately feeling the warmth/comfort in my face. After this repetition, the snow angel represents lying down, my whole body relaxing instead of the uncomfortable sight of the fetal positions done before.
