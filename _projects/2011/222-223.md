In “Hawk/Dove,” I continued trying to understand elements of isolation in society by trying to connect with animals and plant life. In “Hawk/Dove,” as in other works, I specifically tried to communicate with animals that have lost their lives in a humorous and empathetic manner. 

The piece is silent and begins with some foreshadowing of sexual contact between the performer and anthropomorphized chickens. However, the “problem” of the piece is inverted when, rather than fucking the chickens, I transform my body into one and uncomfortably rest in that position for five minutes. The title of the piece refers to the game of “chicken” that countries play with one another in military combat, as in the Cuban Missile Crisis. I see this as an apt metaphor for romantic relationships.
