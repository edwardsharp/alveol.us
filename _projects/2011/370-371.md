A virtual performance created especially for the Not Festival and delivered live via Skype. Live audio and video was created using custom software (Max/MSP/Jitter), sent remotely from Lincoln, Nebraska to the festival in New York City. Because of the bandwidth limitations of Skype, the video needed to be slow-moving and simplified to avoid glitching and freezing. Blocks of slowly-moving pixels mix with the droning, glacial sound, made up of sine waves and field recordings.
