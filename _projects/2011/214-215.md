My “Fire and Sparks” performance sees me entering the performance space attired in a mysterious mask and silken robe with Thai finger claws on my hands. After a series of improvised movements, I remove my robe, revealing a metal plate attached to my crotch area. I then proceed to use an angle grinder on the metal area to evoke a series of sparks. The aim of my performance was to address the issue of female sexuality and self-empowerment. The imposing metal plate and use of a power tool in such a sexualized manner forces the audience to view the artist in a new light. Elements such as danger and pain also highlight what it is like as a female, facing things such as pregnancy, monthly periods and the menopause.
