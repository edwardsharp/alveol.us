“Quale Educazione per Marte?” (“What Education for Mars?”) is an attempt of experimenting an alternative model of knowledge transmission and relationship in school. As Bruno Latour, in his book 

Laboratory Life

 (1979), analyzes scientific discoveries through the study of the relationships between the scientists and their families, “Quale Educazione per Marte?” researches the contemporary school-system via the relations among the students themselves and between students and teachers.

“Quale Educazione per Marte?” is an ongoing community-based project I initiated in 2011. After a series of workshops with high-school students in the city of Rome, I transcribed the interviews with students about their relationships with teachers. The result of these dialogues were then printed and distributed by students themselves around the city, in order to start a dialogue about the role of actual education.
