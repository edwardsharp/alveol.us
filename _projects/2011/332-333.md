“Tyranny Of Time” is a live performance that exhibits the idea of video mediation without the apparatus. Five individuals perform either in fast forward, reverse, normal speed, slow motion, or in the present. 

The urgency for the piece came from dealing with the tragic death of a friend and music collaborator. When we began working on this piece, each performer/collaborator was asked to find a moment they wanted to revisit or correct. I was particularly interested in the actions to which their minds compulsively returned. 

The structure of the piece is set to a poem I wrote about TIME; it is the authority we are rejecting in this work. Instead of thinking about our stories as narratives arranged by linearity or time, I decided to approach them like music. We worked off of a classical arrangement to come up with a spatial organization for the performers. The poem was recited by an invisible voice, which is the authority that reinforces time. He appears every minute, on the minute. The performers do not subscribe to his order, but instead each of them has his or her own schedule-forward, reverse, or in the present.
