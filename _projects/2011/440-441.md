Between the body and language, “Trouble III” explored processes of interruption in an attempt to misalign the performed signifiers with their signified signs. The problem (the trouble) was concerned primarily with how sonic explorations of text could be actions; where chanting, sound poetry and shouting meet. The central action here is sound, in isolation from its signs, the sound of repeated words is the performed action. Language appears as visual text written onto the walls in the performance, the writing is always anagrammatic and often paragrammatic, developing the ideas of repetition and difference within the spoken actions. The objects within the performance return again to the mouth, using objects that also trouble or problematize speech syntactically, logically, rationally and narratively. My deciduous teeth enter back into my adult mouth, mixed with cigar smoke, whiskey and spit. The repetition of actions and words-as-actions, individually and collectively, accumulates, moving away from and out of representation. Slate is used as a platform between my hand and a burning postcard. The sound of slate, teeth and the voice meet.
