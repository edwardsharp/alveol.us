                      	     		ONE is a performance that may take 

                            			ONE lifetime 

                          			ONE person sitting opposite 

                          			ONE person 

there is ONE exchange 

                          			ONE sample of DNA is collected

if desired ONE sample of DNA is exchanged 

this will happen ONE million times 

until ONE million samples have been collected 

once ONE million samples 

from ONE million people have been collected each 

DNA sample will be imaged and from 

ONE million DNA images 

ONE will be made

a composite of all becoming ONE 

This century, will we genetically modify food, pets, our children, ourselves? Information and sharing information is reaching immense speeds and saturation, but what happens to that gray area between public and private? When are our bodies our own, and when are we the property of the global social corpus? Living in times where we rarely put ourselves in situations where we need to trust each other, and in most cases given more reason to distrust, will you trust me with your most intimate material? Your DNA? ONE cannot exist without you.

“One” is a durational performance by me and all of you. This work will be performed repeatedly over the coming years.
