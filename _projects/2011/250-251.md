“Blind” is a performance experiment blending together body-art and interaction design. The purpose of the performance is to transport the audience in an immersive dimension in which the performer becomes the vehicle of an experience of color through interactive sound. 

The webcam is programmed to recognize the special “wave” emitted by the color and the synthesizer to respond live by activating a sound. To each of the four main colors I associated a group of instruments with a well-defined personality: to yellow the madness of the violin, to red the deep notes of the piano, to blue the metaphysics of crystal bells, to green a bunch of acid tones mixed with the hum of the forest. The scientific research on the relationship between sound and color is the starting point of a personal experience in which I discover the connections between the senses. “To smell the yellow, to hear its music, to keep it between the fingers.”
