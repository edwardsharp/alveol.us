Type the description of a process whithout using the delete key. UIpmprovise the process as you tyrpe. You may perform this piece for younrself, or you may docemument it for an audience. Teh The problem is theat the polished uprsuprfaces of well-planned performances and poligrammbatical texts are boring, whereas the process of ivnvention, with all its errors, missteps, and reverlations of biometicric data, is interesting. Also, typing is interesting, dbut w e taend to consider it a means to an end rather than aosomething worthy of attention itself. You may be drunk whisle performaning this youypiece, by the ,way,.
