I hoped that someone watching the performance would be able to relate to the performance’s protagonist, played by myself, and that this act of relating would help them to accept parts of themselves or aspects of society that they’d previously rejected-and that these newly accepted parts might become a source of strength or solace or revelation. And by relating to the protagonist, whom they were probably embarrassed for, they might have felt compelled to start taking themselves less seriously. Strategies used to achieve this: appearing in front of the audience in a robe with heavily painted eyebrows, bringing those eyebrows together in a sad fashion while staring out at audience and rubbing hands together, staring at video projection of a Magic Eye poster for several minutes-miming a disjointed speech that Julianne Moore’s character gave in the movie 

Safe

 (1995), slamming into the wall where the video of the poster was projected. I used emotional, climactic music composed by Jacob Ciocci to intensify the identification with the protagonist’s inner turmoil and catharsis.
