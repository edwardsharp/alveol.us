In this collaborative intervention, we explored the obsessions, myths and terrors of motherhood through repeated acts of uncanny, comic cannibalism. 

Amidst unsuspecting midday lunchers and farmers market shoppers preening in the prosperous autumn sun of New York City’s Highline and Meatpacking Districts, the two young and upright mommies coddled, kissed, licked, fondled, and ultimately devoured swaddled, life-sized babies cast in skin-tinted fudge. Our work deals with the visceral connection to food and reproduction. “Adoring Appetite” explored the desire to destroy what is most perfect, to publicly cannibalize the self in miniature, placid, doppelganger form.
