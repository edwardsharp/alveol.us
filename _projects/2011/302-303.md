“You Better Work” is a 30 minute Aerobic Workout tape produced by Chicago-based artist Jake Myers. More often than not, people are sedentary consumers of video art. This piece addresses that problem by having the viewers get on their feet and actively engage in an aerobic workout. Ten video artists choreographed workouts to an upbeat audio track created by The Hood Internet. The resulting performance is an audience up on their feet and physically mimicking the motions on screen. The Happy Collaborationists selected this piece to be performed at Chicago’s BUILT Art Festival on August 20, 2011.
