We conceived of this puppet talent show as a way to be able to provide free quality arts/entertainment for under-served families while also providing ourselves a flexible umbrella under which to create and develop new and original puppetry works. The talent show format allows us to create very short vignettes that, to our audience, appear to be acts by contestants competing in a talent show, while for Alphabet Arts they are also seeds that we are slowly growing into full-length puppet plays. In “Puppets Got Talent,” a colorful array of hopeful stars-puppets from near and far-strut their stuff in a talent competition like no other. All-new contestants battle the reigning champ, Sweatshirt Man. Singers, dancers, contortionists, comedians, and more! The puppet competitors vary at each performance. With the help of some special celebrity judges, the audience decides the winners. “Puppets Got Talent” is a fun, funny, and interactive puppet show for all ages. For “Puppets Got Talent,” we chose mainly to utilize

 and found-object puppetry, as well as interactive performance, to teach children the importance of imagination, creativity, and collaboration as keys to success.
