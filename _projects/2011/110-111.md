“Dead Tired: Sleep Texts” explores artists’ labor through free-floating apparitions between waking and sleep. The texts between Patty Chang and Thomas Devaney include reveries, exhaustion, blankness, misspellings and misunderstandings. The project of actual sleep texting between Chang and Devaney (sending texts to each other while either coming into or out of sleep) lasted for three weeks at the end of February into early March. Catnaps and the fertile if anxious territory between an artist and a poet are the raw material from which the performance was culled. The audience was invited to both sleep and to text during the performance, which happened in conjunction with video installation by Chang at Momenta Art. Chang’s videos examined the psychic and physical spaces of labor and production. By juxtaposing images of workers peacefully sleeping or resting in the spaces where they work, Chang explores how a space, specifically the workplace, is affected by the energy present. This exploration serves as a kind of refusal of production through not working and maybe even dreaming.
