This piece considers cycles of mass production and consumption and the deep desires that perpetuate them. It questions the ways in which sentimental, monetary, and utilitarian values shift when a personally significant object is reproduced, compulsively consumed, and then discarded. Through the actions of biting, chewing, and spitting, I question whether or not our desires are ever truly satisfied. Materials: unfired clay, table, shelves, stool, pencil, ruler, and baby dish.
