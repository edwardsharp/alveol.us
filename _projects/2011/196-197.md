“Hunger” uses the familiarity of the dinner table to isolate and augment the subtext of small talk between intimate pairs. Two women sit motionless, looking at each other from across a bare table. The women are physically connected by a banded form; their arms are linked in a single tube, as if they are wearing one piece of clothing. The knitted band suggests warmth and coziness, but also becomes a shared straitjacket, confining each to the unrelenting mirroring of the other. In this heightened visual metaphor, each woman has only a single sentence to offer. One is desperate for attention and approval (“Is it good?”), the other is withholding (“If I don’t say anything, it’s good”). Each woman is therefore isolated in her proximity to the other. Exploring the myriad relationships between two people: lovers, parent/child, teacher/student, friends, colleagues, clerk/client, “Hunger” considers all the ways we cannot communicate, but long to connect.
