100 heart-shaped memorials were prepared for the performance, a symbol of the people still missing after the earthquake. Each memorial is an emblem of our solidarity with Japan and its people. 

An explosion at a Japanese nuclear plant has triggered fears of a meltdown; and a massive earthquake and tsunami has left more than 2,000 dead and at least 10,000 missing. Workers douse the stricken reactors with seawater, while Japan’s Prime Minister Naoto Kan notes the chaos unleashed by the recent earthquake was an “unprecedented national disaster.” Nuclear contamination is potentially spreading to all corners of the globe. Pray for Japan!!! 

The performance encourages participants to bring sky-lanterns and other created constructions. These will serve as beacon-lights in dark times. In traditional Taiwanese culture, for example, the sky-lantern served as a message of peace. Lanterns were sent aloft that loved ones might know everything was OK, that life continued in the wake of disaster.
