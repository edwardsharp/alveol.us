“Inside-Out” brings the internal sounds of the human body to our ears. In a contemporary urban daily life, already covered by noisy soundscapes, we generally forget we sound. Nevertheless, such vibrations reflect the very meaning of life. 

In this live performance, I expose my body sounds to the public. The audio signals picked up from my body go simultaneously to loudspeakers and to microcontrollers. My body sounds become audible. Furthermore, they become the power that drives motors. The motors, in turn, play ritualistic music instruments. 

This performance is the result of two years researching the relations between sound and health for my performing arts studies at the University of Brighton, while working part-time at the Royal Alexandra Children’s Hospital. When I started working as health-care cleaner at the surgical ward, the first thing that grabbed my attention was the disturbing soundscape caused by the machines that invigilate the state of the patients. Such example of Western society’s carelessness in relation to sound inspired me to try the opposite: to have my inner body sounds not just well heard but also controlling machines that play musical instruments.
