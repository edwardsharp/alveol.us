In this poetic conceptual piece, the ground was covered in branches and cinnamon spices. The idea of being trapped in roots and coming out of a tree was the main spirit of the movements in this semi-dance and contortion structure. I was wearing a spandex costume in the shape of an hour glass that served the purpose of a head cover and mask and was too long, to create tension as I pushed and pulled through it. I was rolling over the branches, cracking them under my body: a sort of dance for bones. I also jumped, crawled and rolled on the ground. Stretching the fabric and the body in this sensory presentation was a metaphor for adaptation and change.
