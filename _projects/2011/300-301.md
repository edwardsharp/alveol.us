This performance art work is part of the series “Kisses.”

The performance is inspired by the play “The Asphalt Kiss” by Nelson Rodrigues. In the original text, set in the year 1959, passersby and the press of Rio de Janeiro were merciless with the character Arandir, who is accused of being gay after kissing a dying man in the street. The transposition of this text to “performance art” would not be so different when, in an experiment with two artists, a kiss of 30 continuous minutes was performed in public spaces with the artists cross-dressing (he as a bride and she as a groom). We found that the prejudice was immense when the image carried a sexual connotation, still shocking in the morally conservative context.

The action generated a record (video), which can be presented as video performance. This was performed in Stockholm, Sweden, in Minas Gerais, Brazil, and in Porto, Portugal.
