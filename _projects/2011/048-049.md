This performance falls under the category of “LIVE: The Audience as Performer.”

“5 Chapters, 1 Video, 2 Records and a Radio Show” is a team building experience where the audience discovers the performer by performing themselves; working together to figure out the multiple actions of the score. Participants enter into the artists’ studio, which becomes the stage in which they follow instructions to open, turn on, listen, watch, read aloud or play a record, negotiating the space as a collective audience. 

The room is meticulously choreographed so that audience, with a simple amount of curiosity, begin to understand what step is next, one action at a time. A performance score is written on the wall and there is a small TV slide projector revealing a selection of slides, meant as instructions. There is also a record player, chalk, a DVD player and TV. A surveillance camera monitors the room from afar, so at the end of the last action, through a  live wireless mic, a  story pours into the room through the  radio speakers, on the crooked wooden shelves, of why the artist makes art.
