We are playwrighters. How can we celebrate our work? We make an annual event in our backyard and call it “Chochiqq,” and feed hotdogs, theater, and beer to everyone who attends.

Because “Chochiqq” is an outdoor event, you need to think about what type of performance comes across best in the open air. “Chochiqq” is less a theatrical event than a social event with high-quality theater that is happening. It is like a lightening rod for generative energy. “Chochiqq” is an exercise, an experiment in summer weather, precipitation, barbecue, serious dramatic writing and shockingly good musicality. It’s become a Park Slope tradition. It’s an overflowing festival of positive playwriting energies. Intimate intricate hand-made backyard theater potluck where Chos and Machiqqs share shows and food together. It’s family. People are relaxed and at a barbecue in the backyard of a beautiful home, the doors of which are thrown open in hearty welcome, where children live, sleep, and play. And there just so happen to be wonderful plays going on. It is a very special event of relaxed rigor-rigor at play. If you come to “Chochiqq” you will say afterward that it is one of the best events you attended all year. Or maybe the best.
