Problem:

Speeding on the roads and pedestrian safety are real problems in Ukraine.Ukraine has the highest percentage of pedestrian collisions in East Europe-56%.

Idea:

Unfortunately, destroying a living soul is the last thing that can stop a reckless driver and make him think about the consequences. So, we created… “Pedestrian Ghost.”

We made the device out of a manhole cover, helium-filled balloons, and a radar. The radar reacts to a speeding car and then the device inflates a person-shaped Pedestrian Ghost which we put in our manhole cover.

Then we placed it on one section of the city street at a pedestrian crossing. The mechanism reacted to the radar’s signal and triggered the device only when the driver exceeded the speed limit. Then the Pedestrian Ghost appeared out of the device in the manhole cover, and immediately flew into the sky. The dumbfounded driver had no choice but to slow down.

During that one night seven cars slowed down, seven Pedestrian Ghosts soared into the sky, and NO living souls were lost.
