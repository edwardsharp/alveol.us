Then, for the camera, I perform a piece (I composed for this project) for guitar. The noise (the most forceful of a complex wave, consisting of multiple frequencies) from the microphone is translated into music notation. These scores are then performed by a virtual string section (one bass, three cello, four viola, eight violin) available to Java and broadcast from the computer (stereo) audio output channel.","Where the lone computerized string section would immediately sound like chaos, the audience member watches the performance and hears the guitar part (from a spatially distinct location) simultaneously with the computer output (from another spatial location). This encourages the audience member’s perception (likely exceeding capacity) to amass stimuli as a single entity. Insofar as the audience member interprets the visual scene as coherent and comes to feel the guitar part as coherent, the computer part (as a facet linked to the other parts) is no longer a series of random pitches at random intervals. As an appendage, conspicuously lacking coherence itself, it might be lent coherence from other organized stimuli.","What precisely constitutes musicality? I am not concerned with the well-worn question, “is it music?” Rather, I am investigating an elusive border between experiencing a sensation of hearing music (to be attended to), and that of noise. Moreover, by such experimentation, I am hoping to discover the neural mechanism by which we distinguish gestalt groupings (objectively arbitrary) of the intertwined sensory impulse streams worth further attention, from irrelevant signal noise.","In other words, the binding problem of how we might know that the redness and roundness of a ball are features of the same thing, is solved. The binding problem assumes that all entities are bound (in some ideal plane we often call reality), and that we humans passively detect the holism. My proposal here is that features are disembodied and re-assembled in the mind and that holism only exists for the sake of our biologically limited cognitive machinery (the brain)."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"COMPULSION-ATTAQUE.jpg","photo_credit":"Kerwin Williamson","title":"COMPULSION­ATTAQUE","first_performed":"first performed on January 4, 2014","place":"Performance Panoply Laboratory, Brooklyn, NY","times_performed":"performed six times in 2014","contributor":"ANAIS HERAUD","collaborators":["Germany"],"home":"","links":["anaisheraud.com"],"contact":"lab@anaisheraud.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"004-005"},"description":["As the audience enters the gallery, I bring five long and heavy packages into the space with the help of the organizer.

Instead, it builds systems of vortexes.","Performance art is always present, but contains in itself the long breath of the past and the possibilities of the future. When completely aware of its inner temporality, a performance resembles the dialectical image described in Walter Benjamin’s unfinished work Passagenwerk (Arcades Project): “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point.”  Like the Benjaminian dialectical image, the performance artist’s gesture operates within a present that is the living stage of the encounter between what has been and what is yet to come.","Performance art can appear in many different places, but constantly occupies the same space, the space of the encounter between the gesture and the eye, the voice and the ear. The space of the “here and now.” Performance art has no structure, no general rules, but is a heterogeneous, multiple, continuous chain of new and renewed presences.","Present Tense Series was a composite program meant to investigate practices and theories of contemporary performance art through a series of live performances, artist talks and screenings, with the final aim being to open up a significant, fruitful discussion about this particular field of artistic production, which eschews any codification and possible classification.","The program, conceived for SAVVY Contemporary, brought together some of the most interesting performance artists from four continents, involving them in an open dialogue, in the context of which the gallery served as a catalyst of energies and ideas. Present Tense Series did not follow any curatorial ideology, no theoretical preconceptions have to be put at the base of this path.

During the “Clock Hands” performance, the resulting audio score was transmitted to the artist via headphones as she set to the task of retyping the story—a story whose meaning was lost in symbols disassociated by sound and slowness, while, at the same time, its new form as radio transmission was too fast for anticipating fingers. Built into the action was the inherent struggle to keep up, and the inevitability of falling out of time. Pieces of the story disappeared in the resulting textual time map.

The messy relationship did give me a greater awareness of gendered action which I am happy for, but more so it gave me a paranoia of it. ‘tofuhotdog’ deals with desire for something outside of, and a paranoia of, the performance that male bodies put on to survive each other, and the destruction that patriarchal masculinity causes, through the lens of my own body. It’s necessary (if not already a given) to say that my pain is nothing in comparison with the violence women are dealt by men every single day. Much of this piece is me asking what is useful that I can do in relationship to feminist performance work, so I created this piece to process the anger and resentment that I felt towards my own cisgendered white male body, the odds at which I was and am with masculinity and gender at large, in hopes to be able to make space for something else. I think of the piece as an presence exploration of “feminist masculinity,” a term used by bell hooks.

The text is fraught with problems, none of which are resolved. What is gender? What defines our sexuality? What is love? What is war? Le Guin herself described her inquiries as “messy, dubious, and uncertain” in her most recent introduction to the book. This uncertainty is the pivotal point of focus for both the performance choreography and cinematography, which is based entirely on chapter sixteen of “The Left Hand of Darkness.” This chapter sees the two main characters (Estraven and Gently) grow closer as they are trapped in a blizzard together. Here, Estraven quotes a Winterish poem that reveals the nature of the title: “Light is the left hand of darkness and darkness the left hand of light. Two are one, life and death, lying together like lovers, like hands joined together, like the end and the way.” Using this as a jumping off point, “A Bright Hand in Darkness” explores Le Guin’s unique portrayal of gender and sexuality.

Once presented to the king the jester flings off her sweater to reveal a svelte body. Pleased the king gives her a thumbs-up and the ritual begins. Attendant one brings the cabbage and attendant two brings the cleaver. The king—while watching the blonde bombshell—chops the head of cabbage before her eyes, nearly missing his finger. The king then slowly and calculatingly slices smaller pieces of cabbage on the pedestal. Once the entire head is cut into very small portions, the attendants are directed to pick up every single slice and place them in a fur pouch that resembles a vagina.

Sixty years later, someone in a library in Australia tells me about the town and I book a plane ticket from Melbourne to attend the annual Truth or Consequences Fiesta. “Hello There, We’ve Been Waiting For You” is the play I wrote about this town.

The renaming of Truth or Consequences taps into a collective desire for immortality.","“Hello There, We’ve Been Waiting For You” pieces together the fragmented narratives of a town in New Mexico and a dated TV show to tell a new local narrative for Australians. The story of the town represents the fragility of identity, as well as the complexities that come when one tries to reinvent history and the disconnectedness that comes with the individualistic pursuit of being ‘seen.’","In the play, worlds are erected and discarded, a room is only half a room and the laughter is only a recording. Unrelated scenes happen in and around each other to knit together the narrative of a society doing its best to be noticed.

This performance is the most recent iteration of an ongoing project of the same title, in which sound and drawing are translated back and forth in a game of telephone.","In February of 2013, I made a set of drawings as a response to a solo flute concert that Rachel curated and performed. With these drawings, I performed gestures of iteration: one mark tries to follow a musical line in each of the pieces on the concert and any following marks attempt to repeat the first, but ultimately gets translated into a new form that echos the preceding. Rachel made fixed audio pieces based on my drawings by assigning a sound to each of the linear gestures. Those were then measured within the proportions of the page and put into a two minute framework. The translation of the Script-Rescript drawings into flute pieces (some with sine tones and white noise) created a completely new sonic landscape for the flute.

For us, staging Schwab is not merely an exercise in adaptation or interpretation. The play itself, in its humorous, sharp and nuanced critique of the stifling theatrical institution and the dangers of conservatism and nationalism, echoes clearly with the current political and cultural context, bringing forth productive situations and conceptualisations that hold the ability to contribute to a wide range of conversations.","In discussing the play, Director Vanda Butkovic asserts, “Amongst many themes that Schwab is proposing in his final text, the most prominent for me is the death of theatre. Schwab is suggesting that the theatre space is abused by pointless texts and ‘make believe’, used as political mouthpieces. I feel as a theatre community we are in a situation where the very purpose of theatre as a tool for commentary and dialogue is not only threatened, but totally undermined. I am not hopeful about this—I am afraid. I think death of theatre will have the same consequences for the society as the extinction of bees will have for the earth.”","Simon Donger’s scenography takes its cue from the play’s key operating metaphor, air, and consists of inflatable mattresses arranged as a progressively changing and deflating structure. This acts, particularly at the onset, as an interpretation of the ‘theatre stage on the stage,’ engaging with a neo-Brechtian register that destabilises both the real and the representational.","Air thus becomes a discursive material onstage, rather than an operative metaphor. Actors have to respond to the spatial dynamics imposed by such a malleable set. Thus, the set is not merely an aesthetic container for the text but rather it enables a more embedded, embodied and intertextual conversation with the dialogue itself. Similarly, we wanted to invite the audience into the unfolding performance, playing between dichotomies and homogenisation, order and chaos.

Right now the stage is in Finland, a familiar culture. The resources: what are the resources for realizing the performance? In what framework does the performance take place? What is its relationship to money and societal power? Private or common discourse: meanings are formed and received differently depending on whether the performance on stage is private or spectacular.

We borrow the structural principle of the Vine compilation and perform the six-second segments sequentially without interruption or repetition. A quick blackout forms the visual transition between each six second section, while the sound score jump-cuts between corresponding six second clips of music, noise, special effects, television, etc. The movement in the individual segments spans a wide range of choreographic intentions—the recognizably “dance”-like, the gestural, the mimetic, the theatrical and varying qualities of stillness—requiring lightning shifts in performance quality throughout. A key conceptual text we applied to the piece was Sianne Ngai’s Our Aesthetic Categories: Cute, Zany Interesting. Between the shortness (cuteness) of the individual dances, and the durational and serial nature (zany and interesting, respectively), Ngai’s text informed the range of contemporary aesthetics in the work.","Both we as performers as well as the audience are asked to juggle multiple senses of timing—clock time, rhythmic time, body/felt time, and durational time—and sense the congruence and disjunctures between them. The repetitive structure presents an alternative to the classic sense of choreographic development, and builds a sense of audience expectation in the overall duration of the piece. “Time Had a Job” challenges the viewer to process large amounts of information very quickly, to decide whether and how to draw connections between individual pieces and to test their expectations for change over time.","The pieces in our body of work focus on modes of contemporary spectatorship, often creating a particular tension for the viewer. The tension we create in “Time Had a Job” pulls between the audience’s engagement and investment, and a state of boredom and burnout over time. Viewers oscillate between these two states as the piece presents an incessant barrage of new information within a rigid choreographic structure. This tactic references the sense of timing in today’s media landscape and instant-share culture: How many news reports of shootings and injustices does it take before a viewer feels apathetic towards them? How long can we sustain a genuine interest in pictures of cats? “Time Had a Job” similarly saturates the audience and encourages a wide range of qualities of attention as the piece progresses—warning that no piece will last more than six seconds, and promising that something new is always six seconds away."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"THE_BALL2.jpg","photo_credit":"Jason Cerrato","title":"THE BALL","first_performed":"first performed on May 28, 2014","place":"The Buzzard’s Banquet at Soda Bar, Brooklyn, NY","times_performed":"performed four times in 2014","contributor":"JESSICA ROGERS","collaborators":[],"home":"Brooklyn, NY","links":[],"contact":"rogers.jessicalee@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"138-139"},"description":["When I began “the ball,” I thought I was writing a book-length serial poem, but as the piece expanded, the work evolved into something else: a massive performance script.

Desire, ego, our collective ego: for sale. The spectacle of modern culture, the weight we carry within and without, internalized capitalism. The surveillance state. The commodification of self.

An attempt to choke the air with seemingly safe and docile nostalgia. I ask the audience: think of the image of a ball, any ball, perhaps from childhood, kids at play. Hear it bouncing around: the sound of tennis balls being hit—that pop, a baseball cracking off the bat, scores of bouncing basketballs in a high school gym, a handball court, the satisfying ring of a kickball off the inside of a foot. For me, it is always a red rubber ball: sometimes it fits in my hand, a choking hazard; sometimes its dimensions are larger than I can calculate. Imagine playing with “the ball,” outside, a lovely afternoon, a park, a playground.","Then, the audience is asked to imagine that ball being taken away. Someone snatching it. Holding it above your head. Close enough to see but not touch. You remember what it feels like, but memory is now suspect. It is in this atmosphere that the performance emerges, sections of the work delivered in animated gestures and tones from valley girl to predator under the bed, “the ball” allowing itself to be held only briefly before resuming its position as an object of desire. “the ball” as trickster working itself outward into the audience, challenging those present, as well as myself, to take responsibility for the spectacle, culminating in a line which attempts definition, but provides no comfort: “The ball is empire, the Marxists say, but the ball is the empire in you.”"]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"SUNSET_OVER_THE_RUINS_OF_THE_PLASTER_HOTEL.jpg","photo_credit":"Monika Sobczak","title":"SUNSET OVER THE RUINS OF THE PLASTER HOTEL","first_performed":"first performed on May 30, 2014","place":"POST galerija, Kaunas, Lithuania","times_performed":"performed once in 2014","contributor":"DAVID FRANKOVICH","collaborators":[],"home":"Helsinki, Finland / Toronto, Canada","links":["davidfrankovich.com"],"contact":"contact@davidfrankovich.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"140-141"},"description":["I stand on a wooden box wearing a gold t-shirt, my arms outstretched in front of me.

I began to think of how my film work might influence my performance work. In particular, I thought of how Jack Smith’s work in film and performance had influenced me, and how I might be able to evoke a camp sensibility using only the materials I had available to me.

If cubism is the opportunity to see something from multiple angles and perspectives at once, then this piece asked: what would a cubist experience be? “A Serious Banquet” challenged singular perspectives in many ways, the most obvious being that we repeated key scenes from different emotional and visual perspectives so audiences could experience the same scene from many “angles”—a theatrical version of cubism.","Partakers were welcomed into the world of the play by Picasso’s mistress Fernande Olivier, and then invited to talk with a guitar programmed to respond to sound with music; to answer the phone, which recited Apollinaire poems; to listen to a still life (a bottle and vase that spoke); to view Picasso’s Les Demoiselles D’Avignon recreated with live bodies; and to introduce Apollinaire (played by an absinthe glass with speaker) to other guests.

Our figure, Lena Dunham, was chosen for her public persona; a fictionalized self crafted around the perceived anxieties of her generation. Throughout the piece, her name and a constellation of referential paraphernalia are obsessively invoked, leaving a rubble of language and character piled up sculpturally by the play’s end. Divorced from context, these shards of meaning can only be attributed back to the attitudes of the performers themselves.","The narrative imagines a coven of Lena Dunhams living together, enacting the mundane rituals of their daily life through extremes of self-dramatization. The Lenas play make-believe, they prepare for job interviews, they soliloquize. Using found and original texts, we fashioned a mashup that queered expectations of structural cohesion and the separation of character and creator. It was a theatrical culture jam responding to the absurdity of the earnest creative impulse and the pipe dream of economic stability.","Built into the piece’s structure was a false ending that gave way to an incongruous, site-specific appendix. An unidentified speaker enters unexplained and launches into a digressive monologue, jarringly disrupting what was left of the narrative. For each engagement we had, we created a new surreal awards ceremony for this speaker to conduct, supposedly at the behest of the programming institution. Invoking the real names of the institutions’ administration­—and in one case, using an actual administrator as an onstage body performing call-and-response choreography—we gave ourselves a vague but triumphant accolade for “winning” the festival into which we had been programmed. Then, we celebrated with a Broadway song-and-dance. We aimed to turn our attention to the framework we were being presented in, and the problematic hierarchies within it.

Crucial to US interests by the 20th century, the US commanded the Passage from its military base at Guantánamo (GTMO) and via occupations of Cuba and Haiti (1898-1934). The aim was to control the route to the Canal and monitor the countries, which were perceived as unruly sites of black resistance. The Passage is the very reason GTMO is located where it is and US patrol of the waterway continues today.","My question was “who can cross the passage, in which directions, and in what manner?” I had proposed to sail across the Passage and theorized that regardless of the outcome the attempt would reveal information about the geopolitical zone. But crossing by water was only possible by illegal or risky craft. No US-based or licensed boat rental company sails into Cuban waters because of the US embargo and Cuban maritime border regulations. No commercial boat from the DR crosses because they uphold the embargo. No Cuban tourist rentals leave national waters without breaching their own maritime laws. Cuban border guards vigilantly patrol Cuban coasts and the easternmost point of Cuba closest to Haiti, the Punta de Maisí, is highly patrolled because of increased drug and human trafficking as well as regular illegal Haitian immigration. While some Cubans legally travel abroad since 2013, they do so primarily by commercial air travel because airspace crossings by documented subjects who pay the price of a ticket are more easily monitored than water crossings. Thus, I also crossed by air.","I flew from Miami to Santiago de Cuba. From there I took a bus to Baracoa to find a way to the restricted and well-patrolled Punta. Wearing my black-case GoPro, I rode in a 1953 Jeep to the Passage and nearby cemetery where they bury Haitians who die crossing. Accompanied by a Cuban friend of Haitian descent, we paused under the watchful eye of border patrol while he said a prayer at the edge of the water. Several days later I flew to Haiti carrying at his request objects to float in the water on the Haitian side."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"CITYSCAPE(GOATS)_WITH_NORTH_AMERICAN_SHEPHERD.jpg","photo_credit":"Carly J.

Each individual possesses creative ability, as Joseph Beuys the post-war German artist liked to say, to restore the lines of continuity, and re-discover their original path. In this mode of spiritual progress human failure is seen as a condition in which the person has fallen off their “true” path in life and followed divergent roads; many of which consistently lead to death and destruction.","The second mode is more existential and emphasizes breaks and novelty and focuses less on the Plotinian theme of returning to original sources.

I turn on my “GPS” system. The recorded voice of my colleague Guillermo Gómez-Peña (known as GGP) booms in the darkness. At first I just use the “GGP-GPS” to move through space geographically, but quickly the directions become existential, absurd, embarrassing. The GGPS system and I argue hotly, ludicrously—in Nahuatl, Basque, and gringoñol—about choosing ethical directions as artist-activists, body fascism, our contrasting aesthetics and borders of privilege.","It is strange, creating a performance in which you are writing rather harsh lines with which a treasured friend mocks, provokes and berates you. But this is the relationship that I have with Guillermo Gómez-Peña. We smile and jest at each other across porous, fluid, but substantial and significant borders of identity, ethnicity, sensibility, privilege and profession. In our rehearsal process Gómez-Peña adapted and improvised his lines so that they were sharper, stronger, and fit his style.","GGP and I both played cartoonish versions of ourselves; he using a mock-robo-chicano voice and I as a haughty academic with pretensions of egalitarianism. But soon enough the unseen “robot” is subverting and overturning the power relationship—misdirecting me so I miss a faculty meeting and lose my job (to provide a slot, finally for a scholar of color in my ossified department), pushing me to Mexercise™ onstage while quoting Marx in Esperanto, sending me on confrontational missions out into the audience—to exchange bodily fluids, confessions, or legally-binding pledges of solidarity. It is darkly fun to use the premise of El Maestro GGP’s “commands,” which I have written, to push myself.","Gómez-Peña’s directives become more challenging and ridiculous. I fight back. Our differences in agenda and style become starker. However, as we approach a border checkpoint that must be crossed, we reach a synthesis or at least a syncretic truce, in tentative coalition if not in alliance.","Meanwhile, the unfolding performance is a provocation I deliver to myself—a chance to raise the personal stakes in my own aesthetic, to take more personal risk, not just physically on the street but emotionally in terms of self-exposure, and ethical self-critique and implication. Inspired by GGP’s actual lived example, and prodded by this cyborg-fabulous version of him, I intend to cross this border. The piece avoids, I hope, narcissism or solipsism as it uses the “vehicle” of the GGPS to engage with larger issues of racism, scholarship, and dissent."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"THE_LOST_TWELVE_YEARS.jpg","photo_credit":"Tanya Doody","title":"THE LOST TWELVE YEARS","first_performed":"first performed on June 24, 2014","place":"ENCUENTRO 2014 at Centre Phi, Montreal, Canada","times_performed":"performed twice in 2014","contributor":"CHUN HUA CATHERINE DONG","collaborators":["Canada"],"home":"","links":[],"contact":"","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"170-171"},"description":["Performance steps:","step 1.

I also wanted to express that the struggle of the grieving subject is twofold: She must struggle with loss itself and with normative notions of proper grieving.","A powerful component of the piece was the unpredictability that is always at play when a performance directly interacts with spectators in an intimate manner and also the use of ritualistic objects and clothes whose meanings transformed throughout the pieces. For instance, a tunic printed with self-help and psychological texts on the “stages of grieving” served as shelter, wall and a restrictive garment that is eventually torn up, while a number of transparent water filled balloons that I carried across the park conjured images of the womb, tears and containment.","In this sense, “Mouriningfesto” sought to embody and purge the ways in which the grieving process has been repressed, homogenized and regulated, particularly for women.

This is a conscious flesh that makes fun of his own suffering.

The South always resembles mad passion, or living passionately. Yecid has a text that says: “We live the life carnesimente (crimson-ly)” referring to the intensity of crimson. The “sureados” bodies are flesh, raw and sentient. Not surprisingly, the folklore reminds us of the suffering these platitudes in Mexican rancheras, or in the Caribbean music: son, bolero, vallenato (last one the music most listened in Colombia). “Men, women and queers suffer several Latin American infatuation, love hard, we fell in love and enjoyed great happiness, though perishable and fragile. Then comes the disappointment, spite, the open wound of passionate heart.” Pinina says while fruits that have fallen, the head is retouched.","Therefore, the performance of “Carne y Parranda” starts with a passionate love song. And then, as a set of images of fags and transvestites from the South with the charm of their poverty and their bizarre beauty unfolds, this “Carne” tells of his love and failures. Educated by the culture of the soap opera, all altruistic love is a trick—it is just selfishness.

The piece combines improvisation with a written score based in the material language of butter (i.e.: melt, blob, spread, mound, etc.). All of the directives within the score act both as noun and verb, allowing for significant slippage in the translation between languages surrounding this loaded substance.

Walking at an indiscernible pace, the woman releases and excruciatingly slowly drops each stone in the water.","“A Maiden Still Less” conflates the artist’s fascination with materiality, time and presence—fascinations historically shared by the resident Cistercian monks themselves. The monks’ daily practice of devotion is the starting point for the piece. From there the artist applies a feminist perspective to reveal the darker history of witch persecutions of the Early Modern Period that extended to any wise or brave, and therefore outcast, woman. The title of the piece, “A Maiden Still Less,” is adopted from a record of those locally convicted and burned for witchcraft, unnamed: “…the apothecary’s wife and daughter. The prettiest girl in town, aged 19. Four strange women found sleeping in the marketplace. A little maiden, nine years of age. A maiden still less.” The title also refers to the age and experience of the woman presented here, strengthened now, able to release the burden, no longer an innocent maiden. A trail of stones—both invisible and glinting gold on the dark riverbed—remain as markers after the woman disappears into a shadowy underground channel."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"DIANE_THE_AMERICAN_SWIMMER.jpg","photo_credit":"Suzanne Stroebe","title":"DIANE THE AMERICAN SWIMMER SAYS, “DON’T WORRY, AMERICA!”","first_performed":"first performed on August 29, 2014","place":"A Field, Laceyville, PA","times_performed":"performed once in 2014","contributor":"DIANE DWYER","collaborators":[],"home":"Brooklyn, NY","links":["dianedwyer.info"],"contact":"diane@dianedwyer.info","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"222-223"},"description":["“DIANE THE AMERICAN SWIMMER” is an ongoing performance/persona project.

Sociologist Molly Merryman describes “Ode” as “a performance art piece that meditates on male rural isolation, freedom, and peace.” Each of the four segments focuses intensively on a particular figure. The four segments, while differentiated by character, adopt a common visual rhetoric and narrative grammar such that each one stands on its own but is best understood in relation to the other three segments. The emotional resonance of “Ode” derives from the script’s intentional reliance upon the interplay of competing states: pathos and ecstasy, nostalgia and indifference, romanticism and pragmatism. The narrative through-line of “Ode” rests on a radical deconstruction of rural masculinity and, more generally, the nature of human subjectivity in relation to the built and natural environments of the rural Midwest.","On an empty demolition derby track, the night preceding the Annual Montgomery Turkey Trot Festival, a car idles in the distance. “The Crooner” enters the track and lip-synchs to a slow, densely reverberated version of Ricky Nelson’s “Lonesome Town” that plays through the track’s antiquated PA system.

He suddenly accelerates. Mud flies as he tears up the track, completing several doughnuts. As “The Driver” cuts his eights into the dirt, the announcer issues a garbled list of local businesses, the names of random townspeople, and catchphrases from the regional vernacular; he asks unanswerable questions, delivers inscrutable bits of wisdom, and makes poetry of boosterism. The car slowly exits. “The Player” enters the track and plugs his electric guitar into an amplifier. He plays drawn out drones and high-pitched squeals.

As I’ve engaged various aspects of German history with past projects, this anniversary compelled me to create a work that examined how this critical moment in history is viewed today by both Germans and non-Germans. With “Maueramt” or “Wall Department,” I set up a public office along what remains of the Wall that separated East and West Berlin and asked passersby: “What do you think about when you think about the Berlin Wall?” I was dressed in 1960s era office attire; my office desk was an East German camping table that folded neatly for easy transport by an old three-wheeled bike with wooden compartments. Answers were typed on a West German “Princess” typewriter and these documents plus Polaroid photos of each participant were then integrated into an installation at the Museum THE KENNEDYS in Berlin.","The work engaged both young and old and served to provoke reflection on changes over the past several decades that have radically rebuilt the city. Said one Berliner: “I’ve lived in Berlin since 1958. In the West. Without family. Mother and brother remained in the East. It wasn’t easy. Little to eat. Studies and work with no family.” For young people who have grown up without this division, the project served as a provocation and often led to long conversations about the Wall and its impact on people and families. Said one German child: “When I think about the Wall, I think about the DDR and of death and war. And of escape and separation—that many people didn’t see their families for a long time.” For my own daughter, age six, watching the performances led to discussions on protest and democracy and I’m certain that these lessons—enhanced by seeing remnants of the Wall—will remain vivid in her mind for years to come. Her message read in part: “Some people might ask how did they force the government to take it down—they went on the road and lots of people did it and the government went with it because they couldn’t stand to hear all the shouting and see all the signs.”"]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"QUARTER_BEEF.jpg","photo_credit":"Mat Wilson","title":"QUARTER BEEF","first_performed":"first performed on September 5, 2014","place":"Mana Contemporary, Chicago, IL","times_performed":"performed once in 2014","contributor":"EMMA SAPERSTEIN","collaborators":["Industry of the Ordinary"],"home":"Chicago, IL","links":["emmasaperstein.com"],"contact":"emma.saperstein@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"228-229"},"description":["“Quarter Beef” was a performance in which I purchased the front quarter of a cow, hung it in the gallery space, and boxed it for two hours.

I can remember how my fingers felt on her lips and how she would click the vitamin in her teeth and giggle before swallowing. This became a peculiar game to us. With each vitamin I anticipated my next turn. From these memories, I created the piece, “Us, an investigation of consubstantiation.”","The performance begins with a transparent table and chairs positioned under a spotlight. Alone, I sit at the table, clothed in white, with a transparent box in front of me. The box is filled with translucent, moist spheres, smelling of extreme sweetness. I stare straight ahead. A participant sits down in the chair across from me. Our knees touch and our eyes lock in silence. Slowly, I open the box, pick up one of the spheres, and put it to my lips. I open my mouth and place it on my tongue. As I chew, our eyes remain locked. I swallow, I close the box, and I rotate it 180 degrees. I open the box facing the person in front of me. They pick up one of the spheres, and eat it. Each participant reacts differently to this silent invitation and to the taste and texture of the sphere. I close the box, and rotate it 45 degrees. I pick up a sphere and bring it close to the participant’s lips. They accept the offer and open their mouth to consume the sphere from my fingertips. The box stays open and I wait with my mouth open as a gesture for the participant to feed me. The sounds of the gallery surround us, but do not break our connection. The box remains open and the participant and I continue to take turns. The duration of the game varies from participant to participant. Sometimes I lose myself in the actions and reactions.

(I wrote my senior thesis on Jonathan Swift, and my Master’s thesis dealt in part with the miniature object as facsimile.) Part of my inspiration to make “micro” works came simply out of a very New York problem. I cannot afford studio space and therefore, much of this work has been created in the bathroom of the 375 sq ft apartment I share with my husband and my dog. At first I was skeptical that I would be able to create any type of “dance” using only my face, but after viewing the Charles and Ray Eames film, Powers of Ten, I resolved that my understanding of movement and space was only limited by my imagination and not by my physical surroundings. As in my live performance work, I set out to animate inanimate miniature objects. I birth a baby out of my mouth; a tampon erupts from my bloody nose; a pizza pie is randomly ejected; A tiny turkey takes flight. On stage, such minute movements are unable to reach the viewer. Via the camera, the viewer is able to engage with a micro world that challenges the boundaries of proportion and most ambitiously, perception.

By amplifying these inhalations, I highlight the complexities of the breath as part of a paradox of power inherent with expressions of the voice. Positioning the performer in a state of a continuous inhalation is to proclaim (via megaphone) one’s constant state of presence (for the breaths and pauses we take during speech signal a psychological state of thinking, becoming, or about-to-ness). Unlike an exhalation that is mediated through the mouth by the tongue (as in speaking or singing), a constant inhalation obscures the sound emanating from the body, dislocating the signifiers that would otherwise proclaim its identification. With the megaphone positioned closely to my mouth as I manipulate the shape of my oral cavity, the audience was unable to see or anticipate how sounds come out from the megaphone. An important feature of the work, this positioning allows me the ability to both conceal the techniques I employ during performance while also suggesting a tenuous relationship between the body and the technologies that mediate it."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"ANY_SIZE_MIRROR_IS_A_DICTATOR.jpg","photo_credit":"Robert Zott","title":"ANY SIZE MIRROR IS A DICTATOR","first_performed":"first performed on September 12, 2014","place":"Momenta Art, Brooklyn, NY","times_performed":"performed 27 times in 2014","contributor":"PANOPLY PERFORMANCE LABORATORY / ESTHER NEFF, BRIAN MCCORKLE","collaborators":["DREARY SOMEBODY / LINDSEY DRURY"],"home":"Brooklyn, NY","links":[],"contact":"lindsey@drearysomebody.com / panoplylab@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"244-245"},"description":[" // DREARY SOMEBODY / LINDSEY DRURY","“Any Size Mirror is a Dictator” was a process-based dance-opera that problematized reflective methodologies for analyzing, experiencing, constructing, and learning “culture.” Dominant throughout contemporary Western anthropology, philosophy of mind and other fields, reflective theories construct “culture” using formal processes towards understanding, diagramming, containing, reflecting, modelling and mirroring.

By donning the vestment, the majority of my distinguishing features and signifiers (such as sex and age) were subtracted. Additionally my face was obscured by a black ski mask, creating an element of uncertainty regarding my intentions.","Creating a “living image,” the floral figure alternates between stillness and slow movements, yet remains silent. My gestures were simultaneously invitational to interaction with strangers, yet remained consciously internal. Though my figure positioned itself in stances of openness, the lack of verbal communication demanded the audience exercise agency in regards to how they choose to engage the spectacle before them.","Conceptually fundamental is the reality that the work was completed with no associated cost. “The flowers of the fields are free” was constructed outside of any financial exchange: the coat was sourced from the homeless shelter where I both work and live full time, the ski-mask was lent to me, and the hundreds of flowers used to fabricate the assemblage were sourced from donations. These particular flowers were to be discarded as waste prior to my interception of them through my daily work in food/resource recovery. I was particularly interested in showing this work within the format of a large art fair. As an unpaid performer I debuted the piece alongside galleries that were conducting business transactions at an exorbitant level of financial exchange. Thus I became uninterested in creating any further matter that could be commodified, and instead exclusively employed pre-existing material. As the piece is composed entirely of items deemed as “garbage,” the work becomes concerned with questions of labor and privilege. “The flowers of the fields are free” exists because of the waste of others, however it is only through acts of care and an application of time and conscious effort that the possibly transcendent image might emerge.","(It should be noted that due to a miscommunication between festival organizers, all materials related to “The flowers of the fields are free” were destroyed as waste upon completion of the fair. While unfortunate, this reality perhaps seemed appropriate as an unintentional conclusion for both the poetics and the life cycle of the performance.)"]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"CLEAR_BANANAS.jpg","photo_credit":"Ordinary Projects","title":"CLEAR BANANAS","first_performed":"first performed on September 18, 2014","place":"Expo Chicago, Chicago, IL","times_performed":"performed once in 2014","contributor":"ALBERTO AGUILAR / ALEX COHEN","collaborators":["albertoaguilar.org / alexbradleycohen.com"],"home":"Chicago, IL","links":[],"contact":"contact@albertoaguilar.org","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"252-253"},"description":["I teach painting and drawing at Harold Washington College but I use it as a way to teach other things as well.

They were found bricks, stolen or discovered over the course of many years. In the performance they were taken out with alternate movements to build a hearth, then stacked to form low stools around a hearth, then moved to arc around the film. With other synchronized movements we opened up the doors to create an entrance to the van, and manipulated the audience space with ropes as we made several circling passes. The key to the journey was a balance of energy; the car battery was the epicenter. Two more bricks, carefully placed on the gas pedal, charged the battery, while also making the wheels spin at an uncomfortably fast speed. The closed auto-electrical system was kept in motion with a delicate balance of power, as the 16mm film projectors which now sat in place of headlights pulled about as much electricity as the AC/DC converter could supply. The film lasted as long as the circumference of the car, and looped the wanderers forward for as long as the battery would last (approximately 20-25 minutes).","We had found our rising dependence on the car was structured into the design of the city, and that structure weighed on our efforts to make ends meet. So there was a personal problem and a city planning problem. More importantly, it was a relationship problem—the very mechanisms that are meant to close distances produce distances. Think about how many empty seats are sitting in traffic. In our estimating much of the culture feels a need to take short term gains to cope with their long term losses, even though it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. We felt a need to address this object in particular but it was also a stand-in for other forms of technology.","What we had at our disposal to address this vehicle and all of its baggage was a concurrent contemplation about our long-term commitment to each other, as we had decided to marry that same year. While it presented many tempting analogies, what it led us to instead was a sentiment described by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe: “Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together.” The thought was later picked up by Lawrence Weiner to address social structures, in which the brick becomes analogy for human relationship as material. Of course cars and cinemas can be different types of social spaces, but here they came together in a site of exchange that packed up and toured to five cities in the eastern United States."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"UNTITLED_XX.jpg","photo_credit":"Ismael Ogando","title":"UNTITLED XX","first_performed":"first performed on September 21, 2014","place":"Projekthaus on Jessnerstr, Berlin, Germany","times_performed":"ongoing performance for 123 days in 2014","contributor":"ISMAEL OGANDO","collaborators":[],"home":"Berlin, Germany","links":["ismaelogando.com"],"contact":"ogando@savvy-contemporary.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"256-257"},"description":["For this piece—a research project conducted using tools of anthropological field research of Social Psychology for hypothesis validation—I infiltrated an intimate group of 47 Neo-Nazis with the intention to obtain and steal data through the tactics of observation and emulation, data which belongs to a particular segment of German society, a cultural context I have been studying since 2012: “Neo-Fascism.”","The group covers their modus vivendi under a political direction proportionally inverse to their actual doctrine, concealed by political correctness.

The feast itself consisted of animal organs and a pig’s head enshrined in flowers, beads, cutlery, bones and other magical objects. Thesmophoria was an ancient Greek festival honoring of the goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone. A ritual of the ceremony involved burying a sacrificial pig into the earth by night and unburying the decaying remains of the pig sacrificed the previous year to commemorate Persephone’s banishment to Hades. The rituals were exclusive and secretive. I saw the exclusive and mysterious nature of this ritual as one of the first examples of a Queer Safe Space. “Persephone/Tiffany” was the Thesmophoric ritual obfuscated into performance art. The audience witnessed me moving from one side of the dinner table to the other, climbing over the enshrined pig’s head shifting personas from Hades to Persephone. Hades emerged as a strict, virile male energy in a black suit. Persephone was more wild and androgynous, performing vulgar erotic gestures wearing nothing but (at times) a faux-fur coat. I began the ritual performing the dining etiquette described in Tiffany’s Table Manners for Teenagers. Blindfolded, grabbing forks to pantomime-eat an elegant meal, the gestures would trigger a trance like state that would allow me to transform back-and-forth from Hades to Persephone. Persephone’s role was to destroy socially expected rules of the body. Interacting erotically with the pig head, and catching the gaze of people in the space, I became the protest and outrage of Persephone. Hades’s intention was to subdue the outbursts and dominate the wild Persephone. The dinner battle between two characters allowed me to embody the tension and pain of Persephone’s circumstance, and Hades’s oppressive demands. Although Hades wins in the end, the residue of the ritual can resonate far beyond the initial performance. The performance empowers me, the audience and the pig with a sense of confidence regarding the critique and protest of social norms."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"KEY-STORIES_UNKNOWN_FRIENDS.jpg","photo_credit":"Sulieman Abdulla","title":"KEY-STORIES / UNKNOWN FRIENDS","first_performed":"first performed on September 27, 2014","place":"Public Space in the District of Neos Kosmos, Athens, Greece","times_performed":"performed once in 2014","contributor":"KATRIN WÖLGER","collaborators":[],"home":"Vienna, Austria","links":["katrinamuri.net"],"contact":"bureau@katrinamuri.net","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"266-267"},"description":["…tough as a pirate…","Welcome to the island!","No suitcases, bathing suits, sun lotions!","What you have on your body and maybe personal belongings of emotional value.","You stay some time and then go on.

The goal of the prison abolitionist movement is to transform society so that prisons and carceral techniques are no longer needed—to create a world that is truly free and just out of the one we currently inhabit. “Oubliettes” is a follow-up to an earlier collaboration with artist Trevor Paglen, who at the time (2005) was the Critical Resistance artist-in-residence. Critical Resistance was formed by Angela Davis, Rose Braz, Ruth Wilson Gilmore and others in the 1990s to help abolish the prison industrial complex, which they define as “the overlapping interests of government and industry that use surveillance, policing and imprisonment as solutions to economic, social and political problems.”","MDC Brooklyn, also known as “Brooklyn’s Abu Ghraib” after coverage on Democracy Now, is significant as a site where at least 84 people were illegally rounded up, imprisoned without due process and systematically tortured—via humiliation, sleep deprivation, physical and sexual abuse—by the US federal government, shortly after 9/11, using similar methods to those used at illegal US sites around the world. MDC is situated steps away from the trendy Industry City Art and Design center.","Nsumi’s practice involves deep analysis of social systems and grassroots movements for social change, and then carefully focusing an unexpected array of skills, labor and collective intelligence (via the gift economy) so as bring about shifts in perception, increased capacities and catalytic growth within these movements. This process involves research and analysis of how social systems work, the study of collective intelligence and social biology, the complex nature of modern society and the history of social change.","“Oubliettes” involves an array of integrated practices including open-source intelligence analysis and production, strategic mapping, pedagogy, design, community engagement (workshops \u0026 outreach), grassroots neighborhood mobilization, an art installation, zine production and direct action. The work has two tactical goals: informing residents of Sunset Park about MDC and the abuses taking place within it and questioning—for a larger audience—the nature, consequences and trajectory of the PIC and solitary confinement as instruments of state control."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"THEY_WONDER.jpg","photo_credit":"Mel Powsner","title":"THEY WONDER","first_performed":"first performed on October 2, 2014","place":"The Highest Closet, Beverly, MA","times_performed":"performed once in 2014","contributor":"SARAH HILL","collaborators":[],"home":"Austin, Texas","links":["sarahhill.org"],"contact":"","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"280-281"},"description":["By engaging in the art of queer craft aesthetic, I hand-crafted my own version of a Wonder Woman costume.

When I refused to exercise authority the members of our group who had been trained in theater sought to usurp my role.","The apotheosis of stage theater is an ersatz spontaneity, which deploys its synaesthesic array in subtle or surprising ways that frame a pre-existing text as if it were just bubbling forth from an actor’s soul. As an improviser I have an aversion to direction because it often destroys spontaneity in order to create its simulacrum. Why not just present spontaneity?

This was my re-acquaintance period with being Latino. Finally, for the Native song I chose to sing “Ave Maria” as a comment on Catholicism’s effect on Native culture, stemming from my own early childhood.","The facial hair chosen for each phase was a perception of how the world sees me.

The piece is in response to the idea of ‘experience’ as a means of decoding history through memory—as opposed to merely chronological documents—and the resulting speculative evolution of the word ‘experience’ from active to passive. The work is two simultaneous and choreographed (rear) projections; one digital video and the other 35mm slides. Both machines were operated live and the narratives told by both create a tension between the perceived passivity of the technologically contemporary video projection and the—simultaneously memorial and discarded—carousel slide projection. The soundtrack serves to syncopate the imagery and create an artificial time scale. The slide projector reverberated loudly throughout the space while a second audio track played through a PA built up as though generations of sound were piling on one another, creating a cacophony of rhythmic ambient noise. Each image in the slideshow has been reclaimed, written upon with the associations of the shifting language of experience, and when read together holds the structure of a concrete poem in three verses, each of which repeat.

Audience members approached, trying to read the inscribed pen marks. With the sandpaper, Truax then sanded the writing from or further into herself. Ink disappeared as skin flakes and beads of blood rose to the surface of her body. Wrapping her wound in gauze and sitting with the audience, Truax then wrote the name of the female artist, title of a performance and date on the back of the sandpaper before standing to wrap a frame with the gauze, sandpaper and pen.

Having long admired his work with Richard Maxwell and Bernadette Corporation, I took our shared birthday as a sign we should collaborate. The idea of asymmetrical twinship was irresistible. Selfishly, I wanted to discover new ways of working with and through my body from a great actor whose power, it seemed to me, derived as much from his unique physicality and speaking voice as from his writerly sense of the materiality of language, the rudiments of words. I hoped Jim would get something out of working together too.","Before MORTAL KOMBAT, Jim and I had previously written and performed a brief movement-heavy play together called LORNA, inspired by Noh theatre and Butoh. With LORNA, I went in with one goal: to generate the text together from experiments in deconstructed and slowed-down movement, rather than to pre-imagine a text whose duration, structure, and meaning would later be inflected by staging, by Jim’s and my physicality as performers.","MORTAL KOMBAT was an investigation of the structuring elements of physical aggression, by way of the popular 1992 video game. I wanted to take on and to challenge the notion of “a fair fight” and to explore how gender and size inflect questions and problems of physical dignity, active \u0026 passive resistance, and styles of enmity. I wanted to generate language via the exploration of these physical states.","Jim and I developed MORTAL KOMBAT procedurally, by deconstructing movements as we had done for LORNA, taking inspiration from Kathakali, krumping, judo grappling and basic jeet kun do along the way. Our rehearsals walked a strange and very fine line between martial arts sparring practice, double dutch, patty cake, improvisational dance, youtube miming and a mirroring exercise we called “fake t’ai chi.”","We presented a third iteration of MORTAL KOMBAT at the Whitney Museum’s historic Breuer building before the museum moved to its new downtown location. For the Whitney performance, I wanted to add a sonic element to make the building itself, the very architecture, come alive.

I crafted the rehearsal process accordingly; we responded to individual words and phrases in sound and physical improvisation for many months before bringing the entire text into the rehearsal room. Then, as you might call somebody by name in order to converse with them, we allowed the text to fill our mouths and movements.","Specifically, I placed a selection of Stein’s phrases in empty frames around the space. We “listened” to them, conscious as we began improvising with the text through simple, scenic structures, that we move, breathe and only then speak. We observed with care as we handled/were handled by the words—what happened sonically? To our bodies? To the space? To the ways we interacted? We discovered (and used as our fundamental forms) rituals—the dinner party, preparation of food, courtship, seduction—both familiar, yet made newly strange by virtue of Stein’s syntax, which deliberately and playfully cracks open the linguistic and ideological spaces that traditional sentences have marked out for us: “a sentence of a vagueness that is violence is authority and a mission and stumbling and also certainly also a prison.”","The role of food in our culture, history and in the landscape of social strata that is contained within (perhaps especially) the female body was an emerging theme as we worked within the patterns suggested by Stein’s words: the female body as “juice and size and baking and exhibition and nonchalance and sacrifice…” with the paradoxical elements of woman as consumer of food, and also as the object of consumption and its attendant rituals.","As we explored those fissures, we discovered in a visceral way how deeply patriarchal and class/caste-based systems have regulated not only human relationships, but also the language of those relationships. The text, as it were, rose up in our midst and inspired us with how it was to be translated into three-dimensional, theatrical space—creating a playful, absurd and powerful process."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"Corresponding_With_Differences.jpg","photo_credit":"Okko Oinonen","title":"CORRESPONDING WITH DIFFERENCES","first_performed":"first performed on October 17, 2014","place":"Annex of MUU Galleria, Helsinki, Finland","times_performed":"performed once in 2014","contributor":"SHAWN CHUA","collaborators":["Singapore"],"home":"","links":[],"contact":"shawnchuamr@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"320-321"},"description":["“Dear you,","Letters take time, I am beginning to realize.

Simultaneously, the third performer drops a trail of metal chopsticks as she follows a diagonal trajectory through the space. The duo end in close proximity and establish and hold a gaze. There is an abrupt break and they move into a series of movements and pauses, creating various triangles in the space with a white rubber line. One performer leaves the triangle, and then another, leaving a solo mover to create triangles. Using her body inside the rubber line, she creates triangles, which gradually become smaller and smaller, until she can no longer fit inside.

She gradually tosses the chopsticks to another wall where they are picked up and tossed by the third member. She begins an even more rapid sequence, gradually tossing the chopsticks to the far wall, where she begins a very fast sequence creating an almost constant wash of sound. The other two performers stand very close to each other, on the far side of the space, where they are engaged in a duo of “non-touching”; a score which explores the point just before physical touch.

In an inversion of the traditional theatrical process, the abstract narratives of these performances were dictated by the physical and conceptual languages of the surrounding installation and video, i.e., narrative was born from design rather than design based off of narrative. In this way, BCIJPG created a performance that physically expressed compounded, derivative responses to the intersection of exhibition, site, performers, and present.","The performance began in a windowless room with four videos projected on eight by eleven feet screens that, by leaning on four massive columns, created a rectangular room-within-a-room. In this first act, principal BCIJPG members Nancy Hughes, Scott Slocum and Gretta Sowyrda initiated a contact-improvisational dance that seamlessly merged with our on-screen narrative. As we flittered digitally on the four screens, Hughes, Slocum, and Sowyrda tumbled, writhed, floated and twirled in response. At the conclusion of the twelve minute video, Hughes and Slocum led the crowd by song into the second room where they were greeted with our intermezzo performance. In this act, Leduc read a poem with woven impressions of her spatial ideals from atop a stage-like overlook.

As soon as she leapt off the platform, act three began with BCIJPG and guest dancers joining to flood the space. Within a forest of faux, forced perspective columns in-between two 100 foot forced perspective walls, six glowing windows at the far end appeared to be farther away than reality.

We wanted to create a highly naturalistic space for the actors to work in, but wanted it to be available to the audience mostly as film. We created a box set that, at the beginning of the play, was a closed drywall box within which is a mostly fully realized kitchen. The action inside was captured on two handheld cameras following the actors creating a two-camera live film that was projected on two large screens above the set. Over the course of the play, much of the drywall was knocked down, opening up and revealing the “live” space as the play progressed.","Strindberg was compelled by film’s potential and limitations:","“Notice how many shots must be taken in sequence by the cinematograph to reproduce a single movement, and even then the image is still shaky. There is a missing transition in every vibration. Where a thousand shots are needed for one movement of an arm, how many would now be needed to depict the movement of a soul?”","In 1908, nearly twenty years after he had written “Miss Julie,” Strindberg encouraged his collaborator and director August Falck “not to stick to the letter” of the text of the play “but to adjust it to the demands of the contemporary stage.” Where Strindberg used extreme intimacy between characters and close-up psychological theatricality, in this production we used close-up film shots. Where he called for pantomimes and ballets, we created music videos. The production outside of this box set was informed by contemporary pop culture—specifically the music and videos of Kanye West, Beyoncé and Miley Cyrus. These references spoke to me, and to my primarily college-age collaborators and audience, about the sexual and class issues of the play. We used the servants on the estate as a chorus that provided a contemporary “frame” to engage the spectators in a contemporary world of clear-cut and complicated misogyny, violence and violent sexuality.","“Miss Julie” takes a hard look at a couple of human souls, and finds them wanting.

Inspired by Poems for the Men of Our Time (Poemas aos Homens do Nosso Tempo), I conceived this movement-based performance lecture as a way to consistently share the strategies, doubts and concerns around the construction of my work. Before the performance presentation, a diagram of the work process was distributed to each viewer.","When Hilst wrote Poems for the Men of Our Time in 1974, Brazil was under a military dictatorship, which, arguably, suppressed the insurgence of Communism in the country. It came to my attention that five poems in Hilst’s series were dedicated as homages to dissident writers of the communist regime in the former Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (I), Natalya Gorbanevskaya (III), Alexei Sakharov (V), Pavel Kohout (VII), and Pyotr Yakir (IX). These five poems guided the creation of “Phloem.”","By intertwining and overlapping the performance lecture with the diagram and a video with the duration of the 16-minute performance, I crafted the core of my exposure on sharing process. The lecture focused on commentary about the performance score and content related to the work references; the diagram exposed the political persecution of each dissident, allowing the viewers to tap into their works, as well as to get a glimpse of “Phloem’s” structural aspects and further influences, which included the theater work of Tadeusz Kantor and the music of Russian composer Galina Ustvolskaya. It also pointed out aspects of Hilst’s biography and a timeline of the events that brought me to the creation of “Phloem.” The video, filmed in a single sequence frame, showed me in the role of the director who observes, and by this means, captured the movement of the viewer/critic as choreography. While my projected image on the background wall observed the performance, my uncertainties concerning the work were listened to as voice-over narration on the video.

The particular episode I used featured choreographer/filmmaker Yvonne Rainer and her 1976 film Kristina Talking Pictures. The piece transforms as “Andrea Kleine,” the performance artist suffering from stage anxiety and agoraphobia (and also portraying Rainer) as she integrates herself into the 1970s interview and becomes a new character in Rainer’s film, thus changing the story of the film and the direction of the interview. The piece becomes an exploration of the conflicted relationship of performer to performance through a hybrid of dance, theater, television, documentary and group experience illuminating the intersections of fiction and autobiography.","“Screening Room…” is the third project in a series of pieces exploring re-enactment. “Memoir” (2010) re-created my 1999 piece “Memoir Never Was” with the original dancers/actors performing remotely from their homes over video-chat. “Rationality” (2011) was a re-enactment of a 1992 live call-in cable-access philosophy TV show re-staged in my apartment. “Screening Room…,” marked my return to the traditional performance stage/venue after more than a decade. Unlike the other works in the series, “Screening Room…,” (although it used part of a verbatim TV interview) was tasked with defining itself. As both performer and subject, I am all but forgotten by the performance community. By using Yvonne Rainer as a device/mask, I not only (re)placed myself within the continuum of dance history, but also within another person who shed dance for other art forms, as well as within a past era when things were not obsessively documented, which in part allowed me to disappear. Can performance ever truly be documented? Can a life truly be documented? Who are we?

I had limited time to coordinate with exhibitors as to what works they were bringing. I wanted to make it as simple as possible. I did not like trying to select works from the websites, I wanted to hand pick the works onsite and take them for my show. That’s when I conceived the art heist scenario but I didn’t want visitors to believe there had been an actual theft, it had to be over the top and funny so I came up with the title “The Ink Panther” and switched from curator to performance artist.","I created fourteen monogrammed art-handling gloves like those left by the Phantom in the Pink Panther movies. I took one piece from each room allowing the exhibitors to help decide which piece could be taken. In return I left a glove and a clue that could be displayed at their discretion that indicated a piece was missing from their collection. In the Pulp Lounge I hung all of the stolen artworks in the main living space and created an installation in the bedroom that was filled with clues as to the identity of the thief: Vincent J. Kral. The title cards for each work also read as clues telling where each piece was taken from and provided the name and room number of each exhibitor. The performance aspect began as I wandered the fair as Inspector Jacques Clouseau complete with trench coat, hat and a large magnifying glass. I spoke with patrons in character and explained that I was on the case and would have it solved by the end of the fair. This performance piece was important because it became the solution to my curating predicament and added an amusing way for patrons to explore the fair."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"MUSIC_FOR_BODIES_OF_WATER.jpg","photo_credit":"Adria Otte / Adam Adhiyatma","title":"MUSIC FOR BODIES OF WATER","first_performed":"first performed on December 5, 2014","place":"Berkeley Marina, Berkeley, CA","times_performed":"performed twice in 2014","contributor":"ADAM ADHIYATMA / ADRIA OTTE","collaborators":["Shawn Chua Ming Ren"],"home":"Oakland, CA / Singapore, China","links":["adamadhiyatma.com"],"contact":"aadhiyatma@mills.edu / aotte@mills.edu","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"376-377"},"description":["While modern air travel has rendered large bodies of water quickly traversable, our histories and ancestries as travelers/immigrants have been shaped by their danger and impassibility (physically, culturally and economically). The experience of difference, alienation and distance by travelers/immigrants is not just a manifestation of abstract cultural separations; it is the physical imprint of bodies of water on our bodies and selves.","We began to develop a collection of scores focused on one’s relationship with bodies of water. Eventually, a meta-score arose from this collection: “Perform music on one side of a body of water. When you get to the other side, perform it again.” Using this directive as a starting point, we decided to establish a series of performances. The first performance, at the Berkeley Marina and Land’s End, consisted of three pieces.","The first piece, “Imaginary Continent #7” by Adam, was a short composed score for violin and clarinet that moves into an improvisation. We performed this piece at the Berkeley Marina and at Land’s End, on opposite sides of the San Francisco Bay. Performers were asked to be present with themselves and their environment before playing, and to take note of how their embodiment of the music changed from one side to the other.","The second piece, “Pacific Resonance” by Adria was an improvisation to be performed specifically while looking out at the Pacific ocean and had simple text instructions: “Look out at the ocean. Try to see the other side. Send a message.” I would spend time by the ocean, imagining what was on the other side and wondering how my thoughts and intentions might be carried by the waves. To prepare for this, we improvised together by the Bay and discussed the possible resonances of performing by the water.","The third piece was a realization of Adam’s “The Spirit Hovered Over the Water #1.” This graphic score addressed the interface between multiple feelings: the warmth and comfort of community and the tranquility/violence of existing by the sea.

Ever since Roosevelt pioneered the 100 day concept taking office during the Great Depression, the phrase has been used by the U.S. media and scholars as a gauge of political success and activism. In the lives of ordinary people however, the number is often an arbitrary time frame that can demarcate incremental changes in the flow of daily life or a dramatic shift in one’s personal landscape through unforeseen events. With funding in 2014, from the New York State Council on the Arts, I planned this performance to include a small diverse group of local (Staten Island, NY) residents where I live, to be presented in a prominent community space. Select participants, including myself, were given a notebook with 100 pages in which to capture an observation for each day that passed over a three plus month period. The idea was that we would weave these divergent singular observations together and perform them as a group. Then, in late July, Eric Garner’s death occurred within blocks of the performance location which is a historic WPA, New York City Parks building.","This event and those that followed shifted the initial idea for the performance to that of experiences based on the participants’ personal lives. It was also becoming clear as my meetings with these individuals progressed that a different type of expression would be a more accessible way for them to put forward their thoughts to an audience. One of the participants had been on Welfare, one had been to prison and another had overcome addictions. They all had great story-telling abilities and had been through varying types of ordeals; as I got to know them, I felt that giving them the opportunity to share their stories in a public space should take precedence. This provided them the ability to ‘own’ their narratives with confidence. As I gave them ideas about how to present themselves, they became ‘dramatists’ in a manner that would have not have been possible initially. The first incarnation of the performance lasted 30 minutes, and was presented on December 7, 2014. Through interwoven narratives, this version illuminated a range of insights that took into account a specific timeframe (often tumultuous) from each participant’s life, as a point of reference. My dilemma as an artist is that while I often have difficulty with many aspects of social practice and socially engaged art, from an aesthetic perspective I am deeply appreciative of the need for arts culture to embrace differing voices and attitudes. This project is my way of entering into a dialogue within a contemporary art practice that attempts to address the problems and dissonances that face us as a people. I view this piece as an initial exploration in a process that has the potential to grow and expand into a larger form of performative expression."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"IMPRINTING_THE_DARK_PERIOD.jpg","photo_credit":"Nasir Ahammed","title":"IMPRINTING THE DARK PERIOD","first_performed":"first performed on December 11, 2014","place":"Chhobir Haat, Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, Dhaka, Bangladesh","times_performed":"performed once in 2014","contributor":"DIMPLE B SHAH AND AUDIENCE","collaborators":[],"home":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","links":[],"contact":"","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"380-381"},"description":["This performance I conceived as I was entering Dhaka through the roads from the airport to a friend’s place. I saw a very big cluster of tricycle wala taking the road by storm and in a road fully packed with traffic; I could only see the struggle and pain in their bodies which they take constantly to survive in everyday life. For me, as a third person who is looking at whole thing as silent observer, I had to swallow the fact that this is way of life in Dhaka to work hard and survive. This got me thinking two things: one is the position of the “Victim” (the cycle wala) and other one is me, the “silent observer.” I wanted to bring both these elements into my performance work.","In this performance my main concern is to bring into being various social issues which act like boundaries for action and for justice. We are constantly consuming this pressure/tension of society on an emotional and mental level and we keep on absorbing these so-called negativities in the form of Darkness, which accumulates in our system like carbon; if we don’t burn out and convert this into energy, it will totally take us to depth of its darkness. My performance will be an attempt to eject all the negativities of our society in the form of bodily actions.","The act was ritualistic process for both my audience and me. I asked my audience vent out their negative emotions—which are negative imprints of society—by writing on the paper which was supported by dozens of sheets of carbon paper. I also also asked them to write these thoughts on the body of my friend who became a part of the performance who was standing in position of “Victim.” I took a third position of observer, but not silent this time. I did a ritualistic act sitting in a very dominating position where I burnt slices of bread on a kerosene lamp and tried to eat all burnt bread without water. It was metaphorically symbolizing that we in the third position also absorb a lot of negativity if we are sensitive. Later, the paper, on which the negative words were written, was also burnt as incense to spread positive energy. Imprinting the dark was the overall performance where I (observer), “the victim,” and audience all went through the process of taking away negativity in their own way."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"PULL_YOURSELF_TOGETHER.jpg","photo_credit":"Ivan Talijancic / WaxFactory","title":"PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!

I personally come from primarily a theater background, though in recent years have become involved in music as well. I have been amazed by the way musicians are able to gather together and play music with little discussion. Whereas with theater, it’s just different. Of course, there’s that sketch variety of improv that has lots of games and things that people do, and that’s wonderful but not what interests me. I was curious about an improv practice that sits more in the realm of abstraction than situation. And so Uncarved Block was born in 2012. And of course there are schools to draw from, such as Viewpoints and such, and that is wonderful. I am not interested in reinventing the wheel, no, but I am also interested in other objects besides wheels.","Many of the artists of Uncarved Block come from the land of Music more than Theater, and that’s great. But I will tell you now that these are folks not interested in being schooled or learning someone’s technique, and so we find our way through, and discover what works best for us. We make up exercises where we focus on a particular thing, and that attunes our attention to it.","Another thing that we practice—and this comes from David Finkelstein, who has his own deep practice that I have learned a great deal from (and he has led several workshops with Uncarved Block)—is giving ourselves a set of directions before the improv begins.","More and more, I have come to believe that the key is to learn what instructions to give oneself to yield the juiciest results and the greatest concentration.","The Uncarved Block’s powers were used throughout the year mostly in rehearsals. And that is something real and applicable. And I do believe that the best rehearsals are treated as improvisations, which involves exploring within a given set of circumstances, rather than endless repetition.","However, we shared a final 2014 ‘performance’ at SHARE at the Old American Can Factory in Brooklyn, collaborating with the mixed media artists who were there—who were both audience and participants as we were to them that evening.

If you visit Shiraz, especially anywhere near Hafez’s tomb, you’ll likely encounter people (often children) with canaries who, for a couple dollars (and once you’ve thought up your question or wish to yourself) will pick out with their beaks, from hundreds of tiny scrolls, a poem from Hafez that becomes your faal. The FFFAAL Auto-Rhapsodomancer consists of three cardboard divination stations with two chairs per station, one in front of the “oracular divide” and one behind. Six poems are taped to the back of the divide, where the one who delivers the faal sits. On the front side of the divide, drawn in charcoal on the cardboard, are six images with names. Each image has a hole in it—these are the poetry glory holes through which you hear and speak the faal. Each image corresponds to a particular poem it appears in; for example, the image of the “dandelion door” corresponds to a poem (“Home State”) in which it appears. To receive your reading, you let some burning feeling or question arise in silence for you. Once it has, you poke your finger through one of the holes, and the person on the other side reads you the corresponding poem.","The purpose of this simple performance machine is, first, a more complete engagement of the text (you read it—you see the poem—and you are also read to—you hear the poem) and this is done with the ease of relative anonymity (the board is between participants and those remaining in the audience see no faces). You are divined and you divinate too, which not only approximates the actual process of reading, but amplifies it. That is, the purpose of performing poetry as rhapsodomancy is presenting poems as mediums of divination, as potential fortunes. It says, these poems are intended to serve you; they exist primarily for your personal interpretation. What you want to read in it, finding what connects or resonates for you is the point and in fact, whatever you have—a private concern, an ineffable feeling—a poem in its capaciousness and generosity can engage and in the exchange you find yourself holding your own experience differently. I imagine that this is actually what we do naturally (consciously or subconsciously) when we pick up a book of poems and flip to a random page and decide if it speaks to us, or turn to a book we love. So this rhapsodomancy machine works to acknowledge, allow and make overt that process.","Beginning with myself and one volunteer, this machine starts a chain. The one who has received a faal has the option of coming behind the board and offering a faal for another audience member. Soon enough, the auto-rhapsodomancer is in full rotation, which, for the poet (reclined for a moment in the audience) can just watch."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2014","image":"I.W.B.E.jpg","photo_credit":"Monika Sobczak","title":"I.W.B.E.","first_performed":"first performed on December 16, 2014","place":"2nd Venice International Performance Art Week, Palazzo Mora, Venice, Italy","times_performed":"performed once in 2014","contributor":"GABRIELE LONGEGA","collaborators":[],"home":"Venice, Italy","links":[],"contact":"gabrielelnggrl@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"388-389"},"description":["The work is part of an ongoing research about Power.","Power is investigated on different levels and forms: political, social or personal and by using various media like performance, video or visual art.","The main aim behind this performance is to question the audience about the meanings of the actions, symbols and images they are seeing.","1st image: I enter the stage with a flag sewn on my body and I start to remove the pins and set myself free.

I held my hands gracefully as if dancing ballet. Over my shoulder, I held a 14 lb. bag of cat litter. The litter spilled around me and caused a large cloud of strongly perfumed dust to fill the space.

The audience became a blur as I rotated which caused me to lose my balance and fall to the floor several times.
