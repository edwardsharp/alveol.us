For “Broached Topics,” I pronounced four statements in sets of ten related topics while putting on accessories. Each set of pronouncements began with a crass or socially unaccepted statement, followed by rewordings that became increasingly palatable (though contained, equivalently questionable content). While pronouncing the most disgusting statements, I put on many pieces of jewelry. In each set of pronouncements, I decreased the amount of accessorizing necessary to beautify the ugliness of the words. By the end of the performance, my décolletage was encrusted with necklaces, broaches, rings, earrings and tiaras to a claustrophobic extent. This performance was conceptualized to draw attention to the power of words and the lengths people will go to be able to accept ideas that are socially unconscionable by changing the language used to present them rather than changing their actions or belief systems.
