I’ve had it.

I refuse to surrender to the idea that my relationship can only be read as a non-sexual, familial one. This is the way we are made legible when we walk into a room.

“Is she your mother?”

No. She’s not my mother.

MANIFESTO:

This performance gives thanks to Emily Roysdon for her “Ecstatic Resistance essay” and steals her words to say: We are expressing a DETERMINATION to undo the limits of what it is possible to be! This piece CELEBRATES the impossible, REFUSES the set limits of the intelligible, EMBRACES contradiction, BELIEVES in the transformative possibility of sharing and the NECESSITY of communicability, and wants to SPEAK PLEASURE TO POWER!

PERFORMANCE SCORE:

Pairs of self-identified queer women with an age difference of 20-35 years kiss for 1 hour.
