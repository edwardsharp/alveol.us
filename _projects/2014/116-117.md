PANCHO LOPEZ

My work regularly surrounds the day-to-day: rituals established around food, love, despair and the politics of desire. In particular I am interested in manifestations of love (and the processes that come as a result of diverse intrapersonal relationships) and generating pieces that point out and question the ways in which these relationships develop and possibly rupture.

Within the frame of the MEXTRA 2! Festival, I presented “BURGERTIME,” a performative action where I ate ten cheeseburgers against the clock (in a race against myself) to not only demonstrate the ways in which I can simultaneously win and lose but also to explore the ways in which my food disorders, conflicts and behaviors shape who I am.
