“Duty Free Ranger” mashes a park ranger and a dandy in a roving public interactive intervention to awaken passersby on their day-to-day paths and to invigorate free use of public space. The Duty Free Ranger has no duties, holds no police powers, nor enforces laws or regulations. He uses a silver spoon (a la Charles ll) as a mirror to walk backwards and begs for donuts. He then transmogrifies into a baton twirler in a sequined singlet. Spontaneous exchanges inspire curiosity in this intervention exploring culture, class, privilege, fantasy and personal freedom.
