Several FluXus scores were performed at the Fluxjob: Purging the World of Bourgeoisie Sickness Since 1963 exhibition. The score, titled “Hand Score,” was performed by multiple visitors to the exhibit:

	Put rubber or plastic gloves on hands

	Pluck a glove with one hand

	Remove gloves

I wrote this score as an exploration of interactive performance whereas the performers are the audience. They interact with the installation rather than with another performer or audience. I chose to include objects and instructions that held no inherent meaning except for in the imagination or experience of the performer. This provided room for personalized interpretation of the instructions and room to add their own actions.
