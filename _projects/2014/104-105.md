“MAGIC BULLETS” is a hybrid performance on the challenges and processes of healing that explores the retreat to the accepted norm of “prescriptive health.” Whether it’s anti-depressants, chemotherapy or romantic love—our crave for a quick fix has only ridden us more ill and over consumptive. So, how can real healing occur? How do we know we are unwell? Can we ever truly return to health or is it always a journey away, to some other destination? Through a series of seemingly unconnected scenes, events, songs and dance, the piece brings a cacophony of disparate parts into a singular cohesive vision. With a cast of nine performers “MAGIC BULLETS” is an overwhelming, sensory experience that utilizes a rambunctious and immersive performance style.
