I mud wrestled Carol Cunningham who dressed as Willem de Kooning for title of Mud Greatness and the Greatest Painter of all time. I wanted to wrestle de Kooning because of the aggression he painted towards women. My intention was to battle with the aggression to show the absurdity of it. The mud represented paint and was flung all over the walls, faux de Kooning paintings and the audience. There was an announcer, two referees and two trainers. De Kooningâ€™s trainer was Death and mine was Frosty the Snowman. I won the match very clearly and trained for six months leading up to the fight.
