“One Fine Day” is a live, 30 minute long performance, presented at the opening reception as part of “Body Conscious,” a group exhibition by nine internationally acclaimed female artists curated by Dr Emily Newman. The action addresses the issues of female body image in the culture of the scrutinizing gaze, by mining autobiographical and collected personal histories. “One Fine Day” explores the futile attempts to fit into societal ideals throughout the life of a woman, from young age well into adulthood.

Various unique insults aimed at myself were printed on thirteen T-shirts, which I wear simultaneously. I discard one by one off my body onto the floor during a sequence of choreographed gestures, generating a site-specific installation, left behind for the duration of the exhibition.
