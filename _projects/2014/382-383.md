In 2014, WaxFactory began a multi-year developmental process of a new work titled PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER! through a series of studies which will comprise a team of six designers and thirteen performers engaged in an in-depth investigation of Anton Chekhov’s iconic play “The Seagull.” The process is focused both on dramaturgical and design research, but also on developing kernels of choreography, staging, sound score and video design in an exploration of inter-personal relationships amongst the play’s cast of characters. Through this exploration, the WaxFactory team (under the helm of the director Ivan Talijancic) is exploding as many ways in which this century-old play resonates in the 21st century America, and specifically a metropolis that is the New York City. Contemporary parallels will be drawn and incorporated in this work to examine our society’s destructive obsession with celebrity, excess and hedonism. The first showing was a character study for Shoshona Sands, a real estate manager in the Hamptons, developed by the performer Gillian Chadsey in collaboration with the director.
