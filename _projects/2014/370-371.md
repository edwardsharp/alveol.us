This piece is an exploration of my relationship towards beauty in connection with my daughter. What do I want to show her? What do I value? How does she perceive me as seen through the eyes of a baby? Also, this piece is a response to a lack of time and pressure to do too many things at once, as a mother. Often, this results in chaos. By asking my baby to “help” me put on my make-up during this recorded performance, she makes a mess of my face, which in turns makes me look like a monster about to go out in social life. Incorporating my daughter in my work helps me actually make work, which is very private as it is filmed at home as an active performance without an audience but filmed and recorded for its own sake. Going back to the history of early performance work, this is a way of filming reality for me as a mother and an artist.
