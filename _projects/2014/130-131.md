In “Theoretical Fetishes” I wanted to address the subtle way in which society is controlled by others’ discourse. Knowledge is a way of power, and its influence through discourse creates a net of control over the individual body and its desires.

This is a performance where I decided to make a corporal interaction with books on power and sex. The action consists of turning the pages and licking them, underlining with my tongue every word, every page, and every sentence. The time is passing and my tongue is taking over the complete book. With this gesture, orality tries to survive the discourse. In this way I would like to accentuate this oral action as the ephemeral experience that wants to survive beyond the moment, reiterating a desire for permanence and sensuality.

The action is performed in the street; I sit on a bench in the square with a pile of books beside me and I slowly lick them one by one until the last page. I selected books by authors whose works are about power in different fields, such as: Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Giorgio Agamben, Julia Kristeva, Antonin Artaud, Elias Canetti, Karl Marx, among other important authors.
