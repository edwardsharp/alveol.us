Contemplating the new wave of gentrification in San Francisco, which has driven up rents to the point where it would be truly impossible to live in the city again, it occurred to me that the root cause is that I live in a society that values winning at all costs. Tech workers would not be able to make so much money if we didn’t value success and achievement. Government would not be a tool of corporations if we didn’t love power and prestige. So I decided to play the game to win. I turned the Mission district of San Francisco into my own private basketball court. I donned the necessary clothing. I performed the appropriate gestures of the game. I engaged passerby either as teammates or used them as obstacles to overcome and to help me practice my ball-handling skills. I won.
