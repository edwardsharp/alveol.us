“I feel like you know” started in June 2014 and consists of poetic signs that I hold up in the audience of The Today Show for national TV. By transforming the original filming of a television show into a place of artistic exhibition and performance, I am trying to disrupt the narrative of conventional television media. I want to reveal the hidden structures of the medium while also creating interventionist moments for a mass audience and testing what I can get away with within the structure of the show. The only rules for the signs for The Today Show, as stated on its website, is that they cannot be vulgar or political. I view mine as statements on freedom of expression.
