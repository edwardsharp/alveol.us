Set Together is a globally collaborative project that asked participants to share in witnessing and documenting the setting sun on the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere and shortest day in the southern hemisphere—Saturday, June 21st, 2014.

The project explores the interplay between simultaneity and displacement by attempting to render collectively lived experiences into one compounded time and space. Through the simple gesture of watching a sun set, the project intuitively explores the intensifying post-modern need for connection and communal interaction.

Co-ordinated with The International Society for the Study of Time’s conference at the Beijing Normal University over 90 participants from 50+ cities in sixteen countries submitted documentation of their experiences, which now lives as an online testament at www.set-together.com.
