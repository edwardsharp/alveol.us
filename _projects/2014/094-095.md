I created this performance work as the culmination of a year long body of work which explored ideas of person vs persona, specifically when the camera lens was present. “WRITING THE BODY” is a three hour long performance piece meant to be performed live and for the public in an institutional setting. The first performance of “WRITING THE BODY” occurred the night of April. 25th, 2014. I turned the camera on myself and my own personas by performing the act of getting dressed with all of the accompanying accessories for different personas that I possess; artist, partner, receptionist, yogi, etc. I layered each outfit (complete with different types of makeup, wigs and jewelry) on top of each other. The set was the entire contents of my bedroom from my actual bed to the paintings that hang on my bedroom walls. The piece, which began as humorous and light hearted, evolved into the struggle of a woman, trapped and disfigured by her own personas. The viewer saw an intimate moment in the performance of everyday life inside the private and vulnerable space of the bedroom.
