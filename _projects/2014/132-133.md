I perform a ten minute poem while incorporating street battle dance styles, such as juking and krumping. The aggressive “mafioso” poem addresses the complex nature of a bisexual, traumatized, gangster woman and her inability to smile on command. This narrative will be told in a feminine, rogue character created with the use of costume and props.

“Only Young Emo Femmes Allowed” expands the medium of performance poetry by adding an element of dance to transcend the idea of internal frustration. This performance was created to address street harassment through the lens of queer identity with a particular emphasis on bisexual femmes. I wanted to give a face to bisexual femmes who are often unrepresented in the queer community.
