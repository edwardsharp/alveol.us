OS FERMENTATION is a slow-cooking class, a healing ritual, and a spiritual revival of human-microbial collaborations. It is part of Leila Nadir and Cary Peppermint’s new series of social sculptures that work collaboratively with local communities (human, bacterial and ecological) to resuscitate historic food practices and to facilitate recovery from what we call “industrial amnesia.”
