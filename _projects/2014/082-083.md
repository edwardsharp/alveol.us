As a concert pianist specializing in avant-garde music, I have become increasingly active in questioning my role as an interpreter as well as the framework of the performances I offer. “The Family Room” juxtaposed memorized solo piano music that I performed (pieces by Rozalie Hirs and Katharina Rosenberger) with text pieces performed from memory by Savitsky, Kuester, and my brother Brett, written by both Kuester and myself. We removed all of the seating from the black box theatre and installed moveable set pieces built by Savitsky. Each of us wore a costume and adopted a static persona for these performances. While retaining the act of memorization and compartmentalization of each different piece on the “program,” this performance critiqued music recital conventions by not only beckoning the audience to move around the space during the performance, but also by involving text, theatricality and exploring the idea of a family formed by this improbable group of characters.
