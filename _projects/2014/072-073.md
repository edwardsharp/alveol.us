“Neil”—an immersive, surreal, evocative and historical dance theater piece—takes place in a 1963 subway car at the New York Transit Museum.

As if reading the news on his daily commute, a gentlemen ‘reads’ a woman costumed in a paper period dress made of newspaper from the day Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. A duet unfolds exploring private space, public space and outer space.

The piece explores the private act of reading the newspaper while in transit as a metaphor for “going somewhere,” the idea of collectively gaining information through private contemplative moments and the juxtaposition of transportation to near and far space via a moment in history when everyone was watching in awe.
