“BEETROOT” is part of a series of works where I combine imagery and actions from past performances as a sort of physical archive or personal retrospective. I’ve been indexing my visual vocabulary and assembling an action lexicon in order to create remixes or mashups of my work. This approach is relatively new for me. The beet itself is one of many root vegetables I have held in my mouth and eventually chewed into pulp to conclude a performance. Changing from white to black, large silver bowls, paper airplanes, black circles and roots are all elements from previous performances that embrace reoccurring ideas of transformation, alienation, insatiability and an oxymoronic want for escape while longing for home.
