“You May Meet Her” is an IRL RPG centered on a blind playdate with a socially anxious extrovert, her house and her hired help. An entirely immersive and interactive installation “You May Meet Her” is set with 60-plus action items that, once triggered, activate a response that may delight the (singular) guest and voyeurs on the lawn. “You May Meet Her” is in an experiment in embodied encounters in a progressively digital social age, choice, if/then scenarios, social contract, etiquette, danger and safety in unfamiliar situations and surprises.

Ms. Connections, a non-verbal clown who suffers from loneliness and papers her walls with Yellow Pages pages to comfort herself, is reading The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and practicing pro-activity; so she has moved her entire house to the Abrons Underground, hired entertainment, procured snacks, and engaged staff in order to properly, and safely, receive unknown guests.
