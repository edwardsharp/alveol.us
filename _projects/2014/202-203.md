“Postcards from Nevermore” is a one-woman electric guitar radio musical with live performance. Combining original songs, theatrical monologues and abstract projections, it tells the story of two queers who escape a life of violence for Hollywood and heartbreak. The purpose of the work is to create a story-driven musical that is accessible to an audience of any income. Although performed live, it also will be slated for an album release in 2015, which will allow listeners across the world to access this story of the violence, survival and desperation that occurs in young queer love.
