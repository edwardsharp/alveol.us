By working with food, I examine questions of she-male porn, fetish and the value of the female TransBody as an artistic medium. “Kake,Kake,Kake” is a performance that takes place within an immersive installation that presents the body and food as sculpture, blurring the lines between what is physical, art and fetish. Like food, the aesthetic of the body is subjective, and the performance seeks to take back control of the perception of the TransBody as seen through popular culture and pornography and re-present it in an unapologetic, aggressive way.
