The Window at 125 plays host to “Lunch Special,” a work by Merav Ezer and Adi Schneiderman, a married couple who create work collaboratively. For “Lunch Special,” they sit across from one another and share a meal of Thai take out.

The physical limitations of this space neatly confine the meal and its diners to their seats, their moment and their task at hand. As we watch them slowly consume, their physical interactions can be seen as a kind of choreographed dance. A few sentences repeat on a nearby screen creating a zen-like poem, reminding us that this is an ordinary occurrence, both a mirror of the one repeated by so many individuals daily and a completely special shared moment in time.
