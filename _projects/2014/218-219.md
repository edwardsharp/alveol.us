“Typewriters Anonymous” is an offline interactive poetry experience. As anonymous poets, we occupied vintage typewriters whipping up spontaneous poems inspired by short intake forms and distributed freely to audience participants. Through this performance installation we delivered private, one-on-one poetry experiences to audience members as an anodyne to the public experience of being “tagged” or “tweeted,” with the added benefit of providing analogue texts that are not subject to surveillance by the United States National Security Agency. We also worked on manual typewriters because of their aesthetic beauty, kinesthetic sensation and celebration of freedom and privacy to express one’s self outside the boundaries of digital surveillance.
