“Quarter Beef” was a performance in which I purchased the front quarter of a cow, hung it in the gallery space, and boxed it for two hours. At the end of the two hours, I collaborated with a local butcher and we butchered and barbecued the quarter beef. This performance was a part of a larger study on the history of meatpacking in Chicago and meat culture in the United States at large. It spoke to the limited interaction we as consumers and carnivores have with the meat that we consume and sought to bridge that gap. Additionally, it spoke to the feminist politics of meat, and conversations surrounding meat and ethics.
