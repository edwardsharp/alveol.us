In this performance I functioned as a human xerox machine, recording and duplicating the material landscape of Athens, Ohio in May 2014. Starting with the simple question, “Can you describe your favorite thing?,” the “Human Xerox Project” illustrated favorite objects as described by Athens’ citizens. The drawings were then compiled into a collaborative zine which was distributed to participants. The zines are archived by THE HUMAN XEROX PROJECT to keep a real-time, ongoing catalog of American ownership.
