Lisa Simpson is armed with scissors, needle, thread and a musical sewing machine ready to mend and redefine your wearables, creating a melody of change. Watch as garments are instantly stitched into unique sculptural works, following the rhythm of a prepared sewing machine. The performance is interactive and encourages the participation and activation of a constructed sewing space. It explores improvisation and spontaneity, turning skirts into dresses and viewers into performers, making music out of making clothes.
