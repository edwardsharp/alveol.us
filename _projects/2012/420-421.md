A solo interdisciplinary performance by Chad Dembski that took on anxiety in the live event, the debatable line between failure and success and the need for honesty in contemporary society. “Ok/ok/ok” examined how to make a personal show situated between music and stand-up. This performance included a new song on keyboard (“I try”), a reimagined dance from a previous show that was by another dancer, reading of manifestos, recreating a concert song as I wished it had been and handing out index cards with words and sayings on them (acting as both clues and section headings).

The show was at Casa del Popolo, a small concert venue in the Mile End part of Montreal, Quebec, part of an experimental multidisciplinary festival, PHENOMENA. The festival encouraged risk and creating something you feel would not fit into any other programming. The crowd was partially seated and partially standing with a raised stage that included just a simple keyboard, cards for the audience, a microphone, the Guerrilla Art Action Group book and small iPod. “Ok/ok/ok” was a 40-minute explosion of giving everything one has. The audience, who all receive different cards, must access different experiences of the performance.
