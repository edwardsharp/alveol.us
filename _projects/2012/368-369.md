Fluxus artists were in New York City during the week of September 24, 2012 performing and exhibiting in the annual NYC Fluxfest (organized by Keith A. Buchholz). Many artists showed works at Printed Matter’s NY Art Book Fair taking place at MoMA PS1 and performed Fluxus scores for the general public at multiple venues throughout the city.

My score, titled “Release,” was performed by Allan Revich of Toronto, Canada:

	Blow energy you want to get rid of into a balloon 

	Tie it off 

	Let the energy release as you step on the balloon 

	Stand still 

I wrote this score as an exploration of how ordinary actions like blowing up a balloon can have a transformative effect on one’s space. The mere use of breath is known by practitioners of meditation, yoga and exercise to release stress and tension. The intention of the performance is to focus the audience on a visual cue to breathe out their own unwanted energies while observing the score being performed, and to take an ordinary function of the body into the realm of art.
