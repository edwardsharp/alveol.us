I created a wearable sounding object that could offer the subtle sounds of wind chimes as it traveled from site to site, country to country. The sounding object was created from a randoseru (randoseru = a Japanese elementary school backpack) in which I installed a set of iron wind chimes that move with oneâ€™s body. By creating a mobile and traveling wind chime backpack, my hope is that the uplifting sounds of chimes, generated by the rhythm of walking and the wind, will be a welcome reminder and aural contribution to the good energy and flow that exist in the neighborhoods and sites visited during field trip outings. The journey is occasionally traced in a recording while the backpack is in motion, capturing the energetic sounds of the many people and neighborhoods that are visited over the course of the project.

I took my Field Trip Project randoseru on its first field trip outing around Toronto, Canada.

The document of this sound performance exists as field recordings and a blur of visuals from the delivery trip, as I made my way to meet Daisuke Takeya (curator/artist), to hand him my re-outfitted randoseru for the Field Trip Project, an ongoing experimental and nomadic exhibition that continues its travels around areas of Japan and that will return to Canada sometime in 2013.
