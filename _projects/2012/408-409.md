 A PRETTY/SHITTY STUDY<br>FINDLAY / SANDSMARK / PETTERSON 
 “a pretty/shitty study” is created on site from memory, as a study for a larger project about nostalgia and its opposite in technology. Iver, Marit and Pål Asle have followed a selection of locals to their favorite spot in Bergen. This was filmed, twisted into a choreography and filmed again. The presentation lasted for 30 minutes and was shown every hour from 12:00 to 16:00. The choreography drew a subjective, individualistic and nostalgic picture of Bergen, both site-specific and universal at the same time. 
 <br>We were interested in real and imaginary nostalgic memories and their<br>connections to a geography that is personal as well as communal. Can we<br>all be happy with where we are, and when? 
 <br>[Presented as part of the Dans Till Folket dogma-dance project.]
