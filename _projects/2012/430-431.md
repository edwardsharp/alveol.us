Performed as a work in response to Gloria Anzaldúa’s masterwork _Borderlands/La Frontera: the New Mestiza_, this performance draws upon issues of borders, identities and the paradoxical result of such collisions. Employing a visual language reminiscent of maps and cartographies, this work considers notions of temporary boundaries that are inevitably destroyed, restructured and replaced by other boundaries over time. Throughout the performance, the performer(s) are asked to draw lines with tape through a space (can be through the audience, outside, on stage, etc., so long as it stays within the confines of the architecture of the performance venue). As new boundaries are recast and reconfigured obsessively, areas once clear from such arbitrary lines are covered and obstructed, building an amorphous shape of lines and boundaries that becomes indiscernible. This work was also performed as part of SPAM v. 3.0, a party of experimental performance by thingNY at the Flushing Town Hall in Queens, NY in December 2012.
