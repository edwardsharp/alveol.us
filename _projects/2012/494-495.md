 UNTITLED (WIND) 16665 Mulholland Drive  
 JULIE TOLENTINO 
 “UNTITLED (WIND) 16665 Mulholland Drive” is a visual and dance performance for camera. Inspired by the internality and resistance of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s <em>A Dialogue on Love</em>, the sense of inside-ness in Clarice Lispector’s <em>Hour of the Star</em> and the rampant wind of the lower California desert, the piece engages a continued observance of age, temporality, disintegration and loss. Tracking the body’s negotiations of a large piece of found plastic, the performance as a whole explores ways of creating, interacting with and capturing an image beyond standard strategies of documentation.  
 Choreography emerges not only in relation to these contextual constraints, but also through the different capacities and tendencies of the bodies that perform it. Movement derives from direct observation of the urban leftover—fragments of plastic captured on objects—as well as from obstructions, suffocation, urgency, immersion, isolation and noise. This work resulted in 1000 digital photographs.
