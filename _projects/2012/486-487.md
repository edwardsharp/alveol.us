“Sodade” was a one-time performance created in response to the venue of the pop-up exhibition Come Here Often? The exhibition took place in a space normally used as a night club frequented by students of Edinburgh University. Inspired by the name of the exhibition and an article in _GQ_ magazine I’d happened upon, which listed the ten sexiest seduction songs, I decided to seduce the entire audience of the exhibition with a combination of seductive banter, wine, chocolates and dancing, all set to the song _Sodade_ by Cesaria Evora. In my dialogue with the audience, I laid bare my theory that the goal of the artist was to seduce his audience by any means necessary, especially if they’re rich.
