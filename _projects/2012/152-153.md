This play explores issues such as abuses of power, religious hypocrisy and flawed human relationships. The relationships between the characters are often very troubled; they are defined by cruelty, power struggles and indifference. “Peceras,” “the Aquariums,” is the future. Maybe in a decade, perhaps only a month. The laws have changed and the role of women in society has passed a historic turning point. “The Aquariums” are proving to be a great success; new recreational spaces on everyone’s lips. In this piece, we made a strong criticism against all those who hide behind unfair rules for the sole purpose of controlling others.
