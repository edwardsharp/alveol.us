“100 paintings in 24 hours” is a performative piece about process, mass production and systems in art-making. The work is produced on-site in batches, using a painting system with rules and a defined set of resources, and hung in a grid pattern as it is produced. In a gallery setting, it serves to make transparent studio practice—exposing and demystifying the process, causing us to think about our world as being shaped by systems that we design and control vis-à-vis by-products and objects. The prolific nature of the production raises questions about scarcity and value.

I am interested in “task-oriented” performance art, labor and art, and the methods and systems of quantity-production. First introduced during a residency at Oxbow, the work was performed at the MDW alternative art fair in Chicago and as part of the New Capital project, 25DAYS/24HRS in Chicago. Following the performances, each batch of work has had an “afterlife”—the work is made into an animated GIF; posted at an online store using a random pricing method (from $.25 to $250,000), and/or used as the starting point for another project.
