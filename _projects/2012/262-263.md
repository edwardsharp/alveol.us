 ABJACKASS 
 SEAN JOSEPH PATRICK CARNEY 
 “AbJackass” was a site-specific, 30-minute performance and concrete comedy routine that highlighted links between the history of performance art and stunts by the members of <em>Jackass</em>. Using Julia Kristeva’s writings on abjection as original research sources, one-liner jokes and physical comedy routines were then developed to mimic and pay homage to celebrated works of performance in the visual arts and some of the better-known skits from <em>Jackass</em>. These concerns regarding the intersection of abjection and humor are consistent through my interdisciplinary practice, which also includes writing, sculpture, web-based art, sound, and Social Malpractice Publishing, a label that I founded in 2009.
