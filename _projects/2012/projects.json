On January 1, 2012, I began production of a year-long version of “Instruction Manual”: 365 days of continuous recording culminating in a text comprised of every directive I was given during the calendar year. The first part of the work, a performance that ended on December 31, was an extensive act of self-surveillance—the accumulation of thousands of hours of daily audio recordings and video screenshots of my computer usage. The next stage will be the massive undertaking of sorting and transcribing these recordings—transforming them from a shapeless archive into a pressurized text.  "," “Instruction Manual” explores language’s expanding role within larger spheres of production and power. The work’s identity as poem provides an active architecture that is paradoxically both the separation and enmeshing of labor and language; and the year-long act of recording performs the participation of aesthetic production in the exercising and experiencing of these networks. On the one hand, the poetic process, by common definition, is a space to consider language outside of its utilitarian function; the pragmatics of poetry are distinct from those of material production at large. On the other hand, language is the primary material of the poet in producing an object for aesthetic consumption—the poet’s work is language. Meanwhile, language is increasingly integrated and implicated in material production at large. Within the transformation from a manufacturing economy to a service economy, the focus of human labor is shifting to the management and coordination of language; language is becoming the machinery of production. Language is simultaneously the vehicle for communication and the issue at stake—a loaded gun.  "," The performance, together with the text, monitors and metabolizes, centers and redistributes the multiplicity of voices issued by the demanding social, sexual and technological bodies of daily life. The piece aims to reorient our engagement with language, and to explore possibilities for unveiling and unhinging the networks of power we constantly navigate. Meanwhile, through the performative process of recording a year of language—the surveillance of every public and private sphere that I engaged with in 2012—my inherently powered role is implicit in the very networks the work seeks to deconstruct.

Does a blonde girl come to mind? Is she white? Is she smiling? Is there a dynamic element to her posture, perhaps as if she’s standing near a wind machine? “Monday Night” developed out of my search for the natural Blonde. I realized that my questions about blondness weren’t a matter of real vs. fake, but a dialogue between “real” and “natural.” Marilyn Monroe is a real blonde. In fact, she is probably the realest blonde in contemporary history, leading the cultural space once occupied by Cinderella, Barbie and Goldilocks. The natural state of her hair color is a non-issue in the context of our collective imagination. I believe that this material is accessed by individuals the world over and used as a kind of sympathetic magic. Indeed, Marilyn is necessarily a realer blonde than even Grace Kelly (a Natural one), emphasizing body modification as its own specific language.  "," For the performance of “Monday Night,” ten women were cast to perform blondeness. They stood on a small platform wearing a costume of a white Tyvek® suit and clear safety goggles. Wind machines positioned at the four corners of the platform aided the movement of the performers. Each woman was asked to imagine an orgasmic shampoo commercial as an action prompt along with the spirited choreography of National Football League cheerleaders. I composed the accompanying soundtrack using elements of the Monday Night Football theme “Heavy Action” and marching band percussion exercises. At the completion of the soundtrack the performers removed the white suits, which covered their street clothing and exited the performance space.  "," The inevitable question posed in “Monday Night” is: couldn’t I, as a black woman, be a real blonde? Documentation of the performance offered the opportunity to utilize the performers as proxies, multiplying and magnifying my own performance of blondeness. I donned a straight textured wig and, in front of a green screen, danced to the audio track I composed. Then I superimposed my dancing silhouette onto the documentary footage of the ten blondes, filling my form with a magnified video of the original performance.

As the scenic designer for the production, I was faced with the daunting challenge of creating a physical environment conducive to the telling of an epic tale of an anonymous black man’s journey in search of his identity, a metaphor Ellison created for the American experience.  "," The play itself is cinematic in nature; the set embodies numerous locations and is capable of transitioning in a rapid but fluid manner. The set is conceived as a construct built from Invisible Man’s memories. Inspired by Romare Bearden’s work, the set is a collage of visual elements abstracted from significant moments in the protagonist’s life. It is another “character” in the piece, requiring the ensemble to embrace and work with it as another performer. "," Invisible Man begins to tell his story in darkness, his face revealed by the light of a single light bulb. I designed a ceiling of lights, composed of 1369 light bulbs, which illuminated the space to reveal him secluded in his Hole, a cellar space beneath the streets of Harlem. The Hole is delineated by several rolling scrims that act as carriages for smaller scenic units, these can be removed to establish each of the central moments in the storytelling.  "," A drag on a marijuana joint cues Invisible Man’s recollection of his time in the South. The world of the Hole explodes to reconfigure into various locales. His view of his time in the South is tainted; the actual places are not as vivid and colorful as his memories. Castered scenic units; props and flown light fixtures both define the location and motivate the action. The scrims’ surfaces are textured with projected images and often reveal the performers lingering behind them. Scenic elements appear and disappear as needed, but often dwell around the edges of the stage, ever-present as Invisible Man builds his history. "," As Invisible Man reaches Harlem, the set develops into a labyrinth of activity and motion. Everyone lives on top of one another and people become invisible in the mass of activity. This world slowly erodes as he confronts defeating circumstances, building into the chaos of the Harlem riot that ends the play when the light ceiling descends onto the action.

The lie this performance tells is that German filmmakers of the Weimar era, such as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, had developed an avant-garde body of work in the futurist-vein that they kept hidden from the public; it was just too strange, too unprecedented. This piece is meant to explore the ways in which our most shattering truths often come about via outright deception or selective telling, as is the case with information given by filmic or photographic depictions of history. The reality this work seeks is the one that inhabits the space between the event and its artificial representation, materializing in the staggering concreteness of the present tense at the moment a lie announces itself.  "," I begin the performance with a slideshow introduction to a fallacious history which describes the recently unearthed futurist footage. Superimposed still images and swirling film clips that disintegrate the conventions of cinematic figuration are shown from the secret oeuvre attributed to Lang and Murnau.

The recitation speeds up, becomes a little anxious, then fully panicked. But the primary mode of this performance is immersive, not critical. Instead of recontextualizing these song lyrics in order to expose their ridiculous or problematic or exclusive character, “Sunshine Honey” appropriates without derision: what if we were as sincere and as silly as these pop songs? Wait—aren’t we?  "," I present this public language of love as my private thoughts; I insist that it is, and I worry that I can’t go one better or be any different.

I focus especially on assertions of possession and the ways in which these are linked with happiness, retreat and relief. In this performance, however, there is no respite. Every time fulfillment is presented, it is just as quickly pulled from my longing arms by the forces of contradiction and self-doubt (“I <em>guess</em> you’d say”).

When I first participated in KhojLive in 2008, I deviated from a normative pre-condition of performance, namely an active body. I chose to perform absence through a piece titled “Petting Zoo,” for which I anesthetized myself and four farm animals. This year, I determined to engage with the festival’s party atmosphere while maintaining ties to that earlier withdrawal.  "," “Pause to release” is a smaller self-contained party within the larger festival ambiance. Our intimate gathering abandons voice and motion to explore the presence of silence, allowing a partygoer to reflect on the ur-party itself. We express the eloquence of a gathering at a standstill—a still life infused with the eroticism of passing time and the impotence and heft of physical arrest. We are a frozen tableau of partying, in scenes of indeterminate engagement with the attendees of the larger public party.  "," The alert noted our presence and stood by to observe. The inattentive or distracted sometimes sat on our furniture, turning to talk to one of us until embarrassed awareness set in.  "," The tableau was enacted the moment right before or after typical “party moments.” The paradox operated twofold.  "," First, the quiet tableau were experientially the loudest, because the performers’ focus holds silence in unnatural tension with the implied action surrounding each frozen moment. The actors-on-break scenes are unobtrusively quiet, because focus relaxes. There is no history or future implied by these rests: only the performance work that was done and is imminent after the performed break. "," Second, the performers behave as though they are in attendance rather than on stage; the audience has very little to attend to. The tensions between silence and action only acquire force within the understanding of each audience member, through a perception of the relation between the larger party and smaller party. Thus, this piece is performance—it is not theater, photography, or sculpture. "," The work is a reflection of the KhojLive Party we are caught in, except it is more self-aware; it is a party that attends to the machine of art production and consumption. It is an occupation of the party with a counter-gathering, an anarchic refusal to participate in the Party.

When we began making “puppet poems” in 2009, we were struck by how much poetry and puppetry have in common, such as emotional density, lyrical intensity and compaction. We created “Puppets &amp; Poets” (P&amp;P) to continue our explorations of these art forms, and to create opportunities for others to do so as well. P&amp;P is a workshop and festival mixing puppetry and poetry, two of the world’s oldest and most diversely practiced art forms.  "," We produced two festivals in Brooklyn in 2012 (at Brooklyn Arts Exchange in February and The Bushwick Starr in December) that included over a dozen experiments, collaborations and hybrid performances blending these and other arts, with over 60 artists participating. With the highest per capita artist population in the USA, Brooklyn is home to a thriving arts community, yet opportunities for artists (particularly poets) to collaborate across genres remain rare. Western culture often perpetuates the image of the artist as isolated genius, suggesting that those without this title have no business creating art. We challenge this ideology by bringing together diverse artists (including novice and experienced puppeteers, poets, dancers, actors, musicians and visual artists), as well as local youth, to create together. In one 2011 P&amp;P workshop, kids, guided by artists, created toy theaters based on famous winter poems. "," More than 50 diverse artists attended our 2012 P&amp;P workshops, a boot camp of sorts, in which participants collaborated to complete a series of puppetry/poetry challenges. Artists who met at our workshops then spent a month collaborating to create works for the festivals.

My aim was to make a one-to-one performance, with each audience member stumbling onto it by chance, not necessarily aware of their own involvement. I was the protagonist, the performer, producing a social sculpture that moved physically through small roads carrying local traffic, which ultimately contained drivers who would tell me stories about their lives. "," At night I slept mainly in fields, gas stations and sheds and occasionally in truck cabins and on living room floors. In the morning I would go back to the road and wait. Every place I waited I took a photograph of the road looking ahead. Each road the same, each day the same, but each encounter unique.  "," What followed was the fragmented anthology of a series of encounters—a series of photographs of empty roads, and a series of short stories presented as a book and as a live performance with a slideshow of the various locations. ","   "," Through the stories, the photographs take on the history, memory and energy of those who inhabit that place, but also the disinterest of those who simply pass through, using it simply as a transit route.  "," There was no script to these meetings; as one might expect from a one-to-one performance, each encounter was unique depending on the energy I received from the person I met. I noticed however, as I moved across borders, that certain themes were reoccurring—the fantasy of a place on the other side, the fear, hatred or envy of one’s neighbours, and the glorification of the place I call my home—London. The resulting text and performance loosely becomes a projection of home—mine and others—exploring notions of <em>us </em>and <em>them</em>, absurdities and tensions across borders. The encounters are upsetting, obsessive and intimate, drawing deeper and deeper into the dark tunnels of the anxious European mind. Europe—a garden with walls.

He agreed to answer a few questions from those in attendance, including MOCA’s reasoning to allow nude female performers yet forbid nude male performers.

The stage remained bare except for five props: a bucket, a book, a bench, a podium and red and blue fabric used to evoke the movement of waves in the final scene. For the most part, costumes were white with distinct red accents constructed by each performer according to her character.  "," Scalapino does not assign speakers to the lines, rather, the play is a continuous text resembling a poem, so the performers choreographed the text through chance (drawing “characters” from a hat), and then designated certain stanzas or lines to the characters. “Characters” we created included: The Passerby, Someone Else, The Narrator, The Prisoner Pulling Weeds, and The Wanderer With a Book. Scalapino’s text allows for much interpretation, and with this freedom, we created a performance trajectory and narrative naturally, through discussion, collaboration, and rehearsals. The GASP performers are all writers with varying degrees of performance experience.

The performers also helped people cross streets with firemen’s lifts, cleaned things in the streets, gave free tours around public sculptures and clapped and cheered government workers entering and exiting their workplaces. The performers received many thank you’s, laughs, smiles, letters of support and gratitude, and generated much local and national debate around how we value work, investment and citizenry, in addition to critical reflections on the current government’s neo-liberal austerity measures.

Her faith that derived not in G-d, but in being separated from G-d, her belief in living outside, and her condemnation of a book of poetry I held (“That’s not poetry!

"," The experience of creating this work has helped me to make the following treatises on durational performance:  "," Durational performance is concerned with composing sustained practice in space.  "," Durational performance frames processes of somatic transformation that are inherent to bodies. As such, it is a particularly fitting approach to any critique of the processes of social, cultural and political transformation that bodies are made to undergo.

In “Nocturne,” audiences encounter a low platform the size of a bed, where a single performer slowly shifts from side to side as if in restless sleep. A video projection adjacent to the platform displays a “live feed” of the performer, but a second body appears with her. This virtual body slowly shifts and rolls in response to the live performer’s movements. A meditation on absence and loss, the piece aims to capture a somatic understanding of the memory of another. The quotidian becomes the content in a work that relies on the digital to represent the imaginary.  "," Here, the choreography of sleeping becomes a writing of longing. The particularities of the weight of our own bodies and their movements are exchanged like silent words. Through a casual intimacy that cycles through rolling and stillness, the piece tracks the traces of the body, imagining the marks it leaves, and the memory of someone else’s movements. A foot scratching a knee causes the virtual performer to shift her head. It embodies the exchange of movement and gesture across bodies, from the imagined to the real, from the virtual to the present. The piece looped every 40 minutes, shifting between soloists continuously in a durational performance that lasted three hours. "," The choreography of “Nocturne” matched the cyclical quality of sleeping—a performer sits with the audience on low pillows, enters and lies down, slowly begins shifting and rolling, then exits as the next performer starts. The durational nature of the piece allowed the audience to encounter and absorb it in their own time. At first, the image might appear erotic, but shifts to a more ordinary intimacy, and then, to something quiet and meditative. The structure rewarded the audience for staying with it—what seemed improvised was a repeated pattern. Bodies of different genders and shapes repeated the movements, revealing the idiosyncrasies of their embodiment.

Because contemporary society believes in the perfection of technology, this work queers technology by reducing it to become susceptible to the flawed human touch. Technology is just as mortal, volatile and vulnerable as the human body. Physicality becomes the main connection between the organic and inorganic, especially in the playground of performance.  "," Throughout the performance, dramatic chapters occur: an avatar body makes cracks in the wall that bleed light. There are cables embedded into both the wall and the body. The avatar peels off layers of skin-suits as the wall gradually gets physically demolished. Mechanical sounds increase in pitch, sub-frequencies and volume as more and more light is revealed throughout the destruction of the wall. The piece finally ends with a chaotic crescendo and a deafening silence. "," The peeling of the skin-suits represents the war between past identities and new identities, and discovers the ambiguity of the true self. The identity of the performer is never revealed, reinforcing the idea that while we may never see our true selves, we all look the same on the inside. The performing body is neutralized for audiences in order to project their identities onto its white figure so that they may feel as if they are participating. It is a similar experience to first-person video gaming, in that we are all anticipating success vicariously through an avatar, but have to endure unforeseen obstacles.  "," The more we strive to make our identities and our bodies as perfect as technology, the more we forget the importance of accepting our flaws, loss, chaos and pure, raw expression. When you are one with the unknown, the known becomes at peace.

During the course of our tour we developed a repertoire of ten pieces, 32 site-specific works, and one jointly-choreographed piece that was recorded in Detroit (our last venue). Our work rode the line between performance art and contemporary postmodern dance, and employed devices of costume, props and theater, to create engaging work that sculpturally carved out the performance space. "," The Six and Four Articulation Tour was defined by collaboration, the creation of an open environment—almost equal parts performer, choreographer and visual artist—where each person in the group cycled through these specific roles: the performer of one work would be the choreographer of another, creating a series of works connected situationally and conceptually rather than stylistically. "," Unlike the Cunningham/Cage/Rosenberg trio we were less highly marginalized into our distinctive disciplines.

It involved seven performers attached to three separate dog lines strung up between three sets of posts; these posts were counter-balanced with five-gallon buckets that would be filled with water at each venue. “There’s noOne” compared the issue of standardization in public education to the aspirations of the American dream and to the daily grind of life. It emphasized various social trends by subverting slang, jargon and catchphrases embedded in American culture, like “no shirt no shoes no service,” “I want a pony,” and “the pursuit of happiness.” It addressed a loss of self-awareness that occurs as individuals are immersed into a greater social consciousness. “There’s noOne” was presented in such a way that the audience members who viewed the work became sensitive to their own self-awareness and ingrained ties to American culture.

During the piece, three performers were seated in front of microphones. Selected clips from the film were played, many of them featuring small children talking about their anxieties and the ways they dealt with them. At three instances during these clips, the video began to loop and distort, eventually fading into black.

Finally, I show this image to every member of the audience.  "," “Indexical” is a minimal performance, to be repeated with variations in different contexts while collecting the pictures that document it along the way. Afterwards, these photographs will generate a documentation of documentations that questions itself.  "," This performance stems from my collection of second-hand family pictures of people pointing at something or someone with his or her index finger. In the gesture of pointing with your finger there are several iconographic echoes, which allowed me to explore this gesture in a performance that would dialogue with the photographic medium. Therefore, “Indexical” investigates the forefinger and the inherent indexicality of photography and performance, taking as a starting point one of the most apparently naïve manifestations of photography: the snapshots destined for the photo album. “Indexical” refers to a determinate context in which a certain enunciation or gesture achieves a specific meaning. Therefore expressions such as “I,” “you,” “here,” “there,” “now” and “this” are considered indexicals for antonomasia. Indexicality is one of the essential properties of a picture or a performance, in other words, it is its intrinsic semantic dependency in a given situation and context.  "," As Roland Barthes states, every photograph is an extension of the gesture of signaling with your finger and this pure deictic language is impossible to avoid. Photography says: this, this is, it is like that, like this... Something similar could be said about a performance: it happens here and now, this and that happens, it addresses an actual “you”… Drawing a hermeneutical loop, this performance comes from photography to go back to it; this is, to become framing, bi-dimensional surface, captured instant, fragment, abstraction: documentation of documentations. As performance and photographic documentation, it faces fingers that often point out of the framing, thus denoting certain a impossibility of knowing, from the present time, about “that” which was pointed at in, and through, the picture. This loss of referent highlights once again the conflicting relation between performance and photography, the immense contrast between being image and being in a real situation and the vastness of what is outside the photographic frame. So, “Indexical” puts its finger on the sore spot of photography.

A 12-second video circulated on Youtube documenting Russell as he shouted “fuck you Devil” and beat the pavement with his fists. For “Nothing But a Problem to Be Solved by Enthusiasm (This Is What Daddy Does),” I re-performed Russell’s public breakdown. The performance’s title exposes the two-fold impetus for the work: situating Russell’s covert racism and out-and-out paternalism into an artistic context, repeating his gestures as a form of metonymic critique. The performance hails to contemporary debates surrounding <em>Kony 2012 </em>and the “white savior industrial complex.”  "," The white-savior industrial complex, as Teju Cole coined and commented, is an industry of charity and sentimentality which figures Africa as “the backdrop for white fantasies of conquest and heroism,” empowering white Americans to design and implement solutions to Africa’s problems on behalf of, and in place of, Africans. The white savior industrial complex condenses constellational, systemic thinking about racial and economic justice into small, re-producible slogans and big emotional experiences. Showing before and after (frowning to smiling) pictures of African children in the viral <em>Kony 2012</em> advocacy video, Russell coos to his four year old son, “this is what Daddy does.” “This is what Daddy does” were the only words used in the performance—whimpered, screamed and moaned over pacing, heaving, rolling and masturbating. The imbrication of this verbal text onto the physical text of Russell’s breakdown served to uncover the subtext of the <em>Kony 2012</em> campaign: the masculine and racialized rhetoric of American paternalism. I stripped into an American Flag bikini for the performance, attempting to use my own white, female body to short-circuit the oppressive gendered, racial and national logics at work in <em>Kony 2012</em>.  "," While resounding with these critiques, the performance also grapples with the real human pathos of shattered idealism. Presenting this breakdown live—with the sound of hands slapped on concrete, the breath of an exhausted body and the movement of one seemingly possessed by madness—attempted to cut through the emotional distance enabled by the video’s online circulation, short-circuiting affective and intellectual responses. The performance’s second iteration on Mulholland Drive (7721 Mulholland Drive for Los Angeles Road Concert’s Mulholland Dérive) engaged passersby as well as audience members, resulting in the same ending as Russell’s own breakdown: the arrival of the police.

Not a pause for nostalgia, simply a pause for memory.” To pause together, in front of the landscape, side by side with ruins, traces, what some like to call heritage. How much memory in a stone that lies on a path? How many years, kilograms? The recollection, a fantasized memory of the feet that trod that path.

In making the performance, the text operated in two ways: as a collection of ideas to decipher and critique through discussion, and as a poetic inspiration for choreography. Von Kleist praises the marionette—the machine—as a more graceful dancer than the self-conscious human. In response, we used directives and scores to chart the movement of our own self-consciousness as we performed for one another. Some of the these directives included the following questions: "," How can we locate and qualify the kinds of self-consciousness elicited by specific tasks? What is the distinction between holding a carrot between your buttocks in front of an audience, in rehearsal, and in private? How can experiments in self-consciousness challenge notions of grace in dance and the politics of being seen?  "," The directives are literal instructions and material to play with and re-interpret. The invitation to re-interpret undermines language as a device for control as well as any directorial presence. The fluid relationship between instruction and embodied response challenges the traditional hierarchy implicit in teacher and student, director and ensemble, mind and body. The author of the work is comprised of a community, a piling of multiple voices and ways of understanding that produce a singular entity: the performance. "," In our responses to prompts and scores from “On the Marionette Theater,” we observed various points of focus and degrees of internal/external awareness. This material was arranged to produce a performance between dance and task, logic and nonsense. In light of Von Kleist’s ideas on dance, “the Hidden Woods in the Conversation” may be understood as a proposition to consider how the precise composition of language, objects, and bodies might produce a constellation of varying, layered consciousness.

It seeks to make use of the recognizable discourse and language which is applied to the world of performance, and aims to tamper with the mechanisms of its specific value and signification systems. “Chorégraphie, BABY!” is rooted in the idea of ethnographic gathering which includes the making of a compilation of words and expressions coming from articles, books, radio critiques, the words and language used in workshop situations, interviews with colleagues, performance programs, writings of descriptions of works, conversations with artists, etc. This collected language material becomes integrated into a kind of typological scenario.  "," A well-developed and widely understood language surrounds all of the activities which make up our job as choreographers or performers. Performance is swimming in discourse and sometimes it appears as if the language itself is creating the guarantee for the value of a work, as if performance would not be able to exist without the de-codification mechanisms of written descriptions or instructions. The work happens through five axes of practice: Collecting Practice, which originates in the notions of ethnographic notes, database, repertory, dictionary, encyclopedia, inventory, and which will take the shape of an editable form in the future; Discourse Practice, which deals concretely with altering language daily as the generative linguistic mechanisms we ourselves are; Body Practice, which wonders about the communicating body; Drawing Practice, which questions categorization processes through the superimposition of language and image; and Performance Practice, which insists on improvisation as a way of working the relationship to the audience and as a material for disturbing representation itself. The episodes of “Chorégraphie, BABY!” were: (episode 1) “Liver Space Odyssey 22012,” (episode 2) “De Presse(d) Conférence,” (episode 8) “Strange Little Emergency,” (episode 3) “Long Distance Creationship,” and (episode 4) “The Janeline Slopes and the Brotherhood and Unity Orchestra.”  "," Our methodology can be described as dada-analytics, departing from the belief that the way we live, work, speak and write are significant ingredients which modify our activities. The language we use is shaping us, just as we are shaping it. What is our capacity to affect the world in which we live by paying attention to the way we speak, the way we use language, and corollary the way we create performance?  "," On our little divan, we will be busy making a micro psychoanalysis of performing arts. We seek to scratch the unquestioned fixity of this discourse and language, to shift the meaning of its signifiers, to unpack “les mots-valises”—not in order to build a better new word set, but to attempt to create a black and dangerous void through which anything new could arise.

The protagonist of <em>The Vivisector</em>, Hurtle Duffield, is an Australian modernist artist whose preoccupation with truth in art overshadows and foils any relationship upon which he embarks. "," I found over 2,000 color terms in the novel. My color list allows some contextual description, for example “golden flesh” or “sour greenish yellow” as well as simple color terms like “black” or “red.” Using house paint swatches from hardware stores I interpreted the list as closely as I could and made a series of collages with the paint swatches and index cards. These are arranged into ten “chapters,” corresponding to the novel; altogether there are 206 cards. Next, I reread <em>The Vivisector </em>and for each collage determined an oracular reading from the pages where the colors originated.  "," When a viewer engages “The Vivisector Oracle,” I ask them to think of a question, something about which they are uncertain, and to choose up to ten cards to which they feel drawn. I consult my remixed text and deliver the “reading.” The viewer usually tries to interpret and extract meaning from the text, relative to the question they had in mind. I have found that even someone who is skeptical of occult divination systems tries to construct a meaningful connection between their own question and the often quite obscure oracle text.  "," “The Vivisector Oracle” was not conceived as a performative work, but as the work developed and the documents were exhibited, some viewers requested “readings” with me. The audience and the work demanded a performance of each other. In this way I became a channel, facilitating the performance. I came to realize that the effect of the work was in the interaction with viewers, in their own reception of the meaning of the “readings” and in my delivery. Also important is my bearing witness to their interpretation of the “reading.” After two public performances, I realized that the work is to be performed for one person at a time. Since then I have performed private oracles in my studio. The performance is ongoing and continues to grapple with problems of truth, fiction and uncertainty. “The Vivisector Oracle” enacts the way in which people construct meaning and unravel problems faced in their daily life.

On May 5, 2004 the painting was sold for US$104 million at Sotheby’s in New York City. Sotheby’s did not name the buyer, though sources say that it was Guido Barilla, owner of Barilla Group. At the time, it broke the record for the amount paid for an auctioned painting.  "," My idea was to find the way to bring a<em> Boy with a Pipe</em> back to the context of “museum,” allowing the audience to be able to see the art piece that has been literally stolen and hidden for the private pleasure/business of some Italian magnate. In order to take the contrary line, I took a philosophical context from another famous painting by Rene Magritte, which was entitled <em>The Treachery of Images</em>. By fusing those two paintings/concepts, I wanted to ask the question, “Is this finally a Boy with a Pipe?”  "," This three-hour-long living installation was commissioned for TROUBLE #8 performance festival at Les Halles theater. It was a part of the curatorial concept by Antoine Pickels entitled The Great Gallery of Living Sculptures, including seven other living installations/performances happening at the same time in the Grand Hall of Les Halles.

The costume plays an important role in this performance. By wearing the huge soft sculpture costume, the performer is instantly given a role to play—a carnivorous plant.

The costume creates a humorous monster figure that necessitates that the performers communicate with each other in order to coordinate movement.  "," I was interested in making costumes that can be mistaken as a soft sculpture in a gallery context. If the performers do not move, or move very slowly and mechanically, it looks like a sculpture. If the performers lie still and flat on the floor, no one suspects that people are inside. It can be performed by one performer who does not move much, who just sits quietly there and observes the audience. The audience would not notice until they come closer, and the face to face encounter is very awkward. "," When performed by three or four people, the encounter is different. They can all follow the audience around and attack, the flytrap can move like a monster. Sometimes the flytrap likes gentle hugs, and other times the hug is never a hug—the plants don’t let the audience go, and might wrestle the audience member(s) to the ground. "," The flytrap is not too mobile, so the size of the space determines what kind of relations between the flytrap and audience will have.

The problem was interactivity: how to actively engage the public beyond mere contemplation?   "," Our solution was a performance that veered from visual media into the blind realms of olfaction and taste, requiring proximity, and fostering intimate partaking. Borrowing from the knowledge compiled in the exercise book <em>Foraging In Central Kurzeme</em>, published by SERDE, and from Signe Pucena (the director of the art center), as well as my own experience, I foraged herbs that could be brewed into teas. To serve these herbal teas in a “meaningful” way to the locality, I invented a ritual specifically for the region of Kurzeme in Latvia. The ritual was organized along a methodology that I have been developing over the past three years, where I derive movements and mood from scents.  "," I communicate in silence with the audience via the body since I do not speak the local language. However, later on, the Portuguese poet Tiago Ribeiro Patricio, improvising medicinal poetry in his native language (most likely not understood by the local Latvians) occasionally broke the silence to give some rhythm to the performance. Language thus became a sonic device, instead of just a means of communication.  "," The performance circulated through the entire house of SERDE, a 300-year-old wooden building, via two rooms on the top floor, and then went to the ground floor and ended in the courtyard. I enticed the guests to follow me silently from one space to another by serving the teas, with my gaze, and intuitive body-to-body connection, performing barefoot. I associated a particular infusion to each space, and had carved out of birch (a local resource) each corresponding service, and had hand thrown ceramic cups for this performance. The herbs served were: <em>Alchemilla Milefolia</em>, <em>Betula</em> (upstairs), <em>Lamium Album</em> and <em>Artemisia</em> (ground floor), and we ended outside with <em>Fragraria Vesca</em>. In terms of structure I alternated between sweeter notes (<em>Alchemilla milefolia</em>, and <em>Lamium Album</em>) and more bitter and more aggressive greener notes (<em>Betula, Artemisia</em>, and <em>Fragraria Vesca</em>). Tiago eventually passed around poems translated in Latvian, written on ribbons, and on papers folded in the shape of tea bags, which some of our audience members spontaneously read aloud.

Jokes, as speech about war and genocide, are posited and explored as specific forms of witnessing, testifying to the unconscious of the war and genocide. We start with Freud’s position that jokes, and the enjoyment gained through jokes, are short-circuits. Jokes are created in language, as opposed to the comic, which is found in a situation, this being a crucial difference for our work on jokes about war and genocide. These jokes testify to loss and continuing pain. They also enable enjoyment through the joke-work.  "," Enjoyment through jokes is greater if individual images that are short-circuited are wider apart. Short-circuit is a way to examine predominant positions and ways of thinking, shedding light on their silenced and disavowed assumptions and effects. In a short-circuit created by the joke, not only can we understand something new, but also gain an insight into something more important and more disturbing— “rediscovery of what is familiar,” of what we have always already known but about which we have had to be silent. In such a short-circuit, we locate “the help of joke”: to secure enjoyment in something that would otherwise be repressed, to secure enjoyment from objection on the part of criticism, which would end enjoyment. Jokes, as the most social of “all the mental functions that aim at a yield of pleasure,” need three persons to secure pleasure: the person who tells the joke, the person or a situation about which the joke is told and the third person to whom we tell the joke. The first person, or teller’s pleasure is secured when they see the third person, or listener’s, pleasure.  "," Bringing together the first position about a joke as a type of witnessing and the psychoanalytic insight about a joke as the most social of all functions that secure pleasure, through our analysis, we open up the space for witnessing as part of the commons—as space of collective action, speech and thinking. Our thesis is that a joke, though a short-circuit, enables us to open up a space beyond prohibitions and oppression for speech such as: witnessing to war and genocide, the denial of genocide, the position of life that remains after war and the role of myth in cementing the positions gained in the war.

We made good use of the apples that a group of performers had left in the grass the previous day to set the limits of the cage. We also got help from painter Victor Alba to turn the original soundtrack on when required. In the second part of the performance, Di Calogero evokes the modern society woman using high heeled shoes as mechanical elements of slavery, while I, acting as a narrator in the first part, portray the evil part of consumer society. Finally, the bird woman finds the strength to get rid of the pain and connect to her inner self and to nature and therefore can start to fly and have a freer life.

"," In this text, Jelinek explores the marketing and sale of human bodies and emotions in sports with angry wit, questioning our obsession with body image and high performance at any cost. Sport is seen as a medium for fanaticism, as a form of war in peacetime. I decided to stage the text with a group of seven performers, six of whom, in addition to individual roles, also act as the Chorus and are present on stage throughout the play. The Chorus changes from being commentators, to team, to crowd. Performatively, I also played with shifting between the performers playing “themselves,” being “text bearers” and becoming “characters,” underlining the visible construction of characters that is also evident in Jelinek’s text itself.  "," When working on the extended part of the Chorus, the choric performance of the text was treated as musical composition, trying to avoid psychological illustration and instead working with variations of rhythm, tempo, acceleration and deceleration. The result was a kind of Olympic feat of the performers, not only in terms of memorizing Jelinek’s difficult linguistic gymnastics but in performing it chorally, as an ensemble in a highly disciplined fashion.  "," The production also strove to bring out the humor in the text. Jelinek, who considers herself a comic writer, often complains that many productions and frequently the reception of her texts miss the humor in them. Discovering the humor in her writing, we found, is actually something that comes relatively easy to British performers, as there is such a great tradition of punning and irony.  "," Stage design, consisting of 160kg of white toy stuffing, created an ever-changing landscape in performance. Depending on its use and context in each scene, the “fluff,” as it was nicknamed, may bring up associations of snowy mountains, sports fields or a battlefield, the candyfloss sugar coating of the Olympics or the “stuff” that artificially enhanced bodies are made of. It was ultimately left up to the audience how they chose to read it at any given moment. The toy stuffing also underscored the theme of the commercial manufacture of sports events by corporations and the media.

The Photographer, as a character, is someone who borrows and confuses the affects of a leader, journalist, artist and philosopher. They have to contain a multitude. For this incarnation, the audience sat in folding chairs in the middle of the space, and all the action of the four poetic forms happened on the edges of this square. I performed as this multitudinous Photographer, flanked by two Assistants (Stephen Boyer and Alex DeCarli) who wore semi-identical denim outfits. The piece began with captions: the trio of performers stood on stacks of newspapers, rapidly alternating sentences that report voices inside and around unseen photos.

"," The idea of a (less) inhabited, (un)occupied, body, was the main generator of movement material: whether in group phrases or in material where part of the body is “occupied.” Issues of collaboration and compilation and their precarious nature in the present time were taken into consideration. The project was constructed as a “playlist.” This concept would serve as a fundamental tool in the composition and contexts chosen for the piece to come alive on stage. But this playlist was also a means to speak about a dispossessed body—a non-engaged body. It concerns a bodily non-engagement and engages the limit about “our” non-involvement in what surrounds us. On closer inspection it can be seen as a comment on the exhausted nature of our times. Exhaustion resulting from excess: of image, of consuming, of sound or even of movement. It was in the refusal of time, in its extension even to the limit, or in concealing something apparently irrelevant written on a piece of paper, that this playlist found its relevance. What this “(un)occupied body” asks us further is also if the proscenium can still be a valid place to give visibility to these questions.

In a city such as Miami, an important center for North American immigration, asylum seekers simply repress issues regarding their country of origin. Many efforts to overcome this repression are deployed, but often in vain, doomed to failure. "," “Latina del Norte 1” took place just outside a gallery at Miami Design District, a site where most of the festival’s actions and performances occurred. For this action, I used natural elements such as ice and sand. Over a two-hour period, under intense heat, I scraped six blocks of one-foot-thick ice. I did this for each block, making snow and transforming it into small igloos. These <em>witness objects</em> of my northern culture melted quite rapidly and went adrift. Into each block, a hollow was created that formed a lake as the ice melted.

I am writing the practical theory of this alternative literary expression under the main title of “bookperformance.” While “bookperformance” and “readerauthor performance” are products of intimate and private relations between the reader and the book or the author and the book, the “authoreader performance” is a product of a collective re-construction of the book by authoreaders, a term I propose to describe the creative members in these performances.

These boxes were covered in flower wallpaper and in large letters said “Look Inside.” The public was invited to peek through the hole and engage in a conversation about looking and seeing. The flower girl then took a polaroid picture and handed the picture to the member of the public.

To create the sound of traveling over—passing—what bridges do and are made of. Passing as movement, safety, privilege.

A shout provokes a song; a jerk of the body provokes someone else to lie down; a slow drawl is matched by snores. Each participant negotiates the task, the space, the sound, and the other people. These interactions—the “in between things”—constitute the performance. I stand amidst the cacophony of voices, churning out a hand-written record of the events as they unfold.

Located in the industrial space along the waterfront of Buffalo, NY, this particular grain elevator is a series of seven interconnected 120’ silos. The interior of the silos has been stripped of its functional aspects, leaving a haunting shell of concrete and rusted steel that amplifies the acoustics of voices, instruments, even footsteps. Designed around the unique architecture and mythology of the space, this site-specific production offered the community an entirely new perspective within a neglected but treasured historical landmark. Composed collaboratively, “American Grain’s” participating artists designed specific performances for each of the seven silos, accompanied by an original score performed live throughout the event. The space itself dictated the structure of the performance and its pacing. The performance is perhaps best understood by these three representative scenes within the longer performance. ","  <br>Silo 1: Since most audience members have not previously seen inside Marine A, we reveal the space slowly, allowing audience members to explore the cavernous, dark silo as light gradually reveals details of the structure (including its full 120’ height) to the score of a single, sustained note. At the climax of this note the space goes black and a single light appears in the passageway to Silo 2. Ash falls from above and silent narrators beckon the audience into the adjoining space.  "," <br>Silo 2: The scene is stark; a bare bulb flickers. A shirtless elderly man fastened to a chair struggles to speak. Laboriously he recalls a woman he once loved and the invasion that took her away. His final words: <em>a bomber, bombers, we’re running / we’re inside, and my eyes adjust to the blood, up comes her blouse / the gash in her side sucking, spitting air / till her thumb closed it / And I died first</em>. An air raid sounds and the audience moves on.  "," <br>Silo 5: The audience stands in the center of a dark silo. A faint light glows in a hole in the roof above, and a figure, seemingly floating, descends the full height of the silo. Secured by a hidden climbing belt, she wears a costume made of LED lights that she manipulates in pulsing, elongated gestures. She reaches almost to the audience, suspended only a few feet overhead. She pauses, then ascends with breathtaking speed and disappears back through the opening 120’ above her.

Nonetheless there was still a bit of doubt and emotional attachment in the beginning of the performance. I felt the duration of the piece particularly helped overcoming the final obstructions over the course of the performance. The repetitive percussion’s enchanting sonic qualities, physical endurance and visual atmosphere evoked a trance-like state.

Angelina Panova, Rostislav Egorov, Vladimir Salnikov and Nina Kotel, who attended the Moscow shaving in 1992, were involved in this performance. Angelina made the braid and Rostislav took pictures as they did 20 years ago.

I mount the platform, wearing the standard ballet class uniform of black tights and white leotard, and attach the rope to my ballet slipper.

I maintain a strategic ambivalence toward ballet and its meanings. I refuse to align myself with the ideal that ballet authorizes or with the norms it reinscribes with every step, lift and jump.

The sculptures changed during the performance; they are taken apart and torn and they fell, broke and existed inside a large breathing hot air balloon that is constantly in movement and designed to fly. The dancers moved from one end of the balloon to another, each making an effort to complete specific tasks while negotiating the changing environment. The dancers were grounded and fixed by their tasks: wearing 150 pound ice skates casted in cement, or balancing a long rain stick sculpture on their head. The virtuosic dancers were limited by the physical demand of the sculptures, and the sculptures were damaged by the interaction, the desperate actions dealing with balance and weight created surreal and spirited situations.

The curatorial theme of the festival Visualeyez—at which the work was presented—was loneliness. In response to it, I began with a single bench in the middle of an empty gallery, sitting and staring at the white wall. As the hours went by, I started accumulating actions and traces, moving between moments of frenetic energy and quiet stillness, gradually transforming the space into an installation.  "," Alternating between the feeling of being balanced and unbalanced within vulnerable states became relevant in the process of the work. After long hours of struggles with being vulnerable, alone in the room or in front of viewers, I became stimulated with the idea of finding shelter, using my body to do so. From that moment, I started to explore different ways of transforming my body into a house. Persistently drawing, writing and constructing towers of paper, challenging my balance with holding a pile of paper or a glass of boiling water on my head and burning pieces of thread, I obsessively filled the space until I was left with very little room in which to move, and no other choice but to be a house.  "," In a world of constant change, where the need to adapt to new situations is required, how do we engage with time, presence, ourself and others? What does “feeling at home” mean? Rather than finding answers, I am interested in creating a space to allow both the viewer and the performer to reflect on these questions. With “Intra Muros II,” I also wanted to investigate a format of presentation which would permit the performance to continue even in the absence of the performer just by the traces and objects left behind, thus leaving space for the viewers to bring their own responses to the work.

The problem I wanted to interrogate concerned the value of performance itself to the public in general and to the art world in particular. Was it possible for live art/performance art as a distinct form to genuinely engage the public and creatively extend the language of performance into the wider public realm? (Without it moulting into another form i.e. street theater.) Or has it, as an art form, evolved into a dead end, with nothing new to say or offer outside of its varied self-reflexive and inward–looking coteries, communities and institutionalized settings?

It was also a celebration of Jackson’s 90th birthday, a love letter to my dance community and a recreation of a child’s-eye view of the 1970s New York “avant-garde” arts world.

People who picked the same poems worked on interpreting those dances together. A programmer created an algorithm that distributed all 40 poems across the three nights of performances, using a methodology similar to the one used to create the poems. Schedule conflicts, childcare and other life circumstances provided a further randomizer. The structure of the piece was a combination of all these factors.

The networks are both online and offline, including handmade wearable electronic fashion and face to face agreements between people. The networks are being established through a series of workshops, performances, presentations and discussions at art, activist and academic venues in the Americas and Europe. The project was started by Micha Cárdenas but is rapidly expanding into an ecology of networks involving many artists, hackers and activists. "," Autonets includes a line of mesh networked electronic clothing with the goal of building autonomous local networks that don’t rely on corporate infrastructure to function, inspired by community-based, anti-racist, prison abolitionist responses to gendered violence. The Autonets garments, when activated, will alert everyone in range of the the local mesh network who is wearing another autonet garment that someone needs help and will indicate that person’s direction and distance. "," For this performance, Micha Cárdenas, Allison Wyper and Karen Anzoategui held a workshop in San Jose for Autonets to develop movement to use in the performance to create a group choreography that would express the concepts of building networks to prevent violence against women, queer and trans people, people of color and differently-abled people. We did this, combining my knowledge of Theater of the Oppressed with Allison Wyper’s knowledge of the Pocha Method to create a workshop environment for a group of participants who work in performance, theater, performance studies and community organizing.

Starting from the idea that dance is primarily a kinesthetic experience, this project explored the possibilities of transmission of dance via kinesthetic sense as opposed to visual sense, for example; by providing instructions to the doer, who enacts the dance in order to access it. By doing so, dance is potentially able to reach a critical mass without being recorded on a media other than the body. The audience becomes the carrier of the information, or of the choreography, and the work itself. The context of the performance emphasized live experiences and prioritized real time-space exchanges between people over virtual exchanges, while using the virtual space and technology to spread and promote the value of participation/live experiences, bringing us back to our mere physical bodies, and relating our physical experience of life to the technology we so much depend on, which has already begun to compete with our physical existence.  "," “Choreography for Audience — Take One” was entirely performed by a participating audience expressing itself as a choreographic/social experiment as well as a live film scenario. It gathered upwards of 250 people, divided in four teams, who participated in a live human game. The participants followed algorithmic instructions that were sent ahead of time via email; when enacted, they generated patterns and formations that could be watched from a bird’s-eye-view. The event was only open to participants and not spectators, but participants were allowed to step outside temporarily to see the results of their team’s work from the above balcony. Played in an unpredictable sequence, initiated from within and based on the rules provided, a series of 12 different games engaged the players in cooperation and competition with each other, to generate aesthetic value together in real-time and space on a large grid made of hundreds of 2’x 2’ squares.  "," The various games were based on the deployment of complex systems that rely on sets of simple instructions, and that resembled computer coding or emulated patterns found in nature, while also containing elements of strategy and point systems defining higher stakes in the act of participation.

A week? A month? What does this look like? What can those cans be made into? How much do they weigh? If we convert that weight into something else, is it worth more or less? My interests were literally material: what can we make out of something that we have determined is worth a particular amount in one context, and how much more or less will the created thing be worth? This question is a particularly interesting one for artists who work in performance: how much more is a situation worth if it is highlighted and presented as a live event, rather than just happening as part of everyday life?

The staged work takes place between the burlesque stage and bathroom that features LCB’s toilet altar to Lupe Velez, a burlesque and Hollywood Mexican actress who purportedly died with her head in the toilet. Velez and LCB’s story are presented side by side in order to foreshadow the destiny of my burlesque persona.  "," The most important technique used in the show is the “happening,” a time-based art practice in which the audience is the participating component. I draw on ten years of burlesque audience commentary to develop racist sound montages and voiceovers that force FML audiences to play the role of the interracial incompatible racist audience, LCB’s source of racial melancholia. To accomplish this, speakers are placed in audience seating so as to convey that voiceovers are coming from audience. They are also asked to throw tortillas at LCB throughout the show. These active audience strategies implicate the audience in LCB’s misrecognition and melancholia and illuminate how her performance of <em>spictacles</em>, perverse Mexi-phobic minstrel spectacles that aim to disrupt colonial gazing, fail as the result of the audiences reading these subversive minstrel performances as reality.  "," Featured <em>spictacle</em> performances include LCB as La Virgen de Guadalupe who gives birth to a Hatachi Wand Vibrator, a Mexican servant who jacks off onto tacos with a Tapatio strap-on, and finally a performance where LCB shovels soil into a bathtub in preparation for her own burlesque death. The aggression toward the audience within each <em>spictacle</em> performance increases as she realizes she is being misrecognized via the racist voice-overs assigned to the audience. LCB hatefully glares, shouts and threatens to hit the audience with a shovel. LCB’s inner landscape is explored via video montage in bath, via an endurance-based performance of laughter, and finally through an emotional performance where LCB retires/flushes her burlesque persona into Lupe’s toilet alter and transforms into a reviled creature, a cockroach. The final performance has LCB dressed as a cockroach and using the passage of time strategically, three minutes, to smile. This expressive use of the human body calls for the recognition of endurance amidst the consequences of failure.

The purpose of the work was to address the lingering effects of the 2008 Obama presidential campaign by interrogating the substance beneath its slogans—the significance of “branding” optimism, and the unrealistic expectation that a black president would fundamentally change the overall racial power structure in the United States. Dissecting how these terms (“hope” and “change”) are unfulfilled desires, the piece examined how they are constructed and controlled through forms of popular entertainment and consumerism. This work unpacked the aspirations for hope and change as a fantasy of racial harmony and reconciliation. Specifically, the piece showed the connections between marketing Blackness to make white people cool, and marketing Obama as a way to make white people absolved of racism (using choreography to RUN-DMC’s “My Adidas” intertwined with Nas’ “Black President” as an example).  "," More broadly, the work also looked at how these “political libidos” are re-programmed by entertainment and consumerism to manifest as desire for other things. Moving beyond the questions of whether or not the activities of consumption are superficial distractions or absorptions, the work embraced the possibility that small choices—from songs on a playlist to what hair care product we buy—provide a sense of meaningful control when people feel disempowered and overwhelmed. However, the choreography also pondered the effects of divorcing hope and change from actual power, exposing a collective lack of imagination.  "," The performance revolved around a female pair—one Black, one White—who attempted to confront each other throughout the piece. The nature of their relationship was fraught, competitive and distrustful, but they were also hungry for an alternative way to connect. Surrounded by a team of four masked performers meant to embody social forces—three white, one black—this team manipulated, seduced and impeded the pair in a variety of ways, including feeding them sneakers, smothering them in body care products, physically assaulting them, whispering, yelling, and caressing. Eventually, the team was unmasked, revealing how large social forces are bound up with individuals. The soundscape included samples from Obama’s campaign speeches, Superbowl commercials, number-one pop songs from 1979-2012, and a 1980s remake of Sam Cooke’s “Change is Gonna Come.”  "],"needs_review":true,"pages":"364-365"},{"volume":"2012","image":"HermioneSpriggs.A_Model_Splattered_by_the_Thing_Itself.jpg","photo_credit":"Kate Clark","info":["A MODEL SPLATTERED (2)","first performed on September 27, 2012","Space4Art, San Diego, CA as part of EXPLOSIVE TIME: Session III","performed once in 2012","HERMIONE SPRIGGS","Sam Duscombe, Misaél Diaz, Amy Sanchez, Robert Leathers, Cheryl Nickel, Vabianna Santos, Jessica Sledge, Chris Warr, and many others","San Diego, CA / York, UK","hermionespriggs.com"],"description":[" A MODEL SPLATTERED (2) "," HERMIONE SPRIGGS "," Spring 2012 by an isolated hot spring in the Colorado Desert.

Painters look at objects to depict them, and then turn their attention to the painted figures. Repetition of this process influences the painter’s original perception of the object.

Using elements of the original archival material shot during those performances, I then made a short film set to a soundtrack of original music by Thurston Moore. I have decided to return to the subject and to explore it in deeper focus within a performance space.  "," I wanted to go back to Jack Goldstein because the memories I have of him are at once haunting and enlightening. Suicide is the great silencer. I ask myself, what’s on the other side of all of that eternal silence? Finding a way to represent the darkness at the end of life is the goal of the piece. What those final days, hours and minutes look like before taking that ultimate step is what the performance examines, rather than trying to dissect the reasons for arriving at the final destination. Goldstein, who talked about a fear of disappearing while continually using it in his work, finally made it his life’s central focus and its defining action.  "," I wanted to find a way to tell the story without telling the story. I decided to use music as a set of annotations which cannot be read literally. Finally reflecting on my relationship with Goldstein years ago, I came away wanting to know if it could have been me hanging from that rope, and the work I’m doing on and about Goldstein are further steps toward answering that lingering question.

I enlarge the concept of solo to include my creation of stage sets via a laptop computer and projector that I manipulate during performances to create a multimedia environment. Moving and altering the computer is an integral component of “Ouette” and adds a very present, behind-the-scenes reality to the fluid movement between fantasy and reality. The laptop is both a physical partner and virtual vehicle through which I attempt to control my world. Through projections, the work expands from a solo to a duet (with the computer) to a group work (through video). I travel beyond the space in which I generate emotional, if not a physical freedom. Traveling—whether actual or metaphorical—becomes synonymous for sexual liberation and empowerment.  "," “Ouette” was roughly inspired by the 2003 film <em>The Swimming Pool</em> by Francoise Ozon. The film ignited controversy with its ambiguous nature and unclear conclusion. The video merges snippets from the film, iconic images, mysterious light and shadows and patterns. For example, reoccurring imagery such as my paisley vintage shirt hints toward my own biography. The projected images create a counterpoint, an objectified partner, if you will, to my solo dancing. The choreography suggests a narrative, and yet is elusive and slippery as to resolution or even meaning. Our relationship to mortality, reflected from a point closer to the end of life than the beginning, is deepened and expanded as the dance progresses.  "," The role of the audience is crucial in both dances. I challenge the audience to engage as active participants who must continually make choices throughout my performance. For example, I project images onto audience members, bathing them in light and highlighting their presence. I view my interaction with the audience as simultaneously intimate and voyeuristic; seeing my audience as active witness influences the content and execution of the performance and blends the public and private.  "," In addition to popular music, original music by Canadian composer Owen Chapman was used in the piece.

In “Notes on Funk III” (1984), Piper wrote that white Americans “might evade victimization by this syndrome [of the Other] by fully recognizing and celebrating all the dimensions of their cultural identity as Americans.” I am a white American; I do not know how to country line dance.

Meanwhile, I “prepare” the stage with an intuitive dance ritual, putting the lilies in the shape of a star, followed by an improvisation based on my reflection on my own artistic process: an ending of a few years’ journey, through the present moment and towards an unknown, new beginning. As the dance comes to stillness, and light fades, the sound calls for attention with a kitchen utility drumming solo, the musician raising his voice, maybe representing the ego, or the call back to everyday reality. "," The performance is, for me, a prayer from the soul to the Self, for an ending of one possible life and an exclamation toward another, or perhaps a combination? The trust and truth lies in the unknown future, shaped by a now. The spoken word is also more of a communication with the surrounding nature than a poem, guiding me to the intention of the forest walk. I believe that the soul is ahead of us, and in improvisation, it is actually the soul guiding the way, and the body just has to follow. So the performance is a way of communicating that way of being, and hopefully to connect to the often neglected soul within the city people, enhanced by the natural elements and symbols; the performance is most of all a call from and to the wild.

Since the first event in 2009, we’ve made IWY events in a variety of spaces, from nightclubs to galleries, but also other domestic spaces (including a small bungalow on an eroding cliffside in Yorkshire). Queer domesticity is the connecting thread for IWY and the spaces we use always reflect this interest. There are two dimensions to this interest that always seem to exist in some sort of tension. Flexibility, collectivity and alternative understandings of the domestic tend to be paired with the provisional, temporary and precarious. This is far from a unique observation, but we try to bring our attention to this dynamic in our work, even as it structures our own day-to-day lives in ways we may not be aware of. IWY is an opportunity for us to work through some of the politics of queer domesticity, but also a way for us to create space for emotional and physical reactions to these politics.  "," Throughout the IWY project, our house on Mayola Road in London has been a hub for artistic, social and domestic activity for our queer community. In 2012, the owners of the house put it on the market, and in October it was sold. This was not unexpected—none of us thought of the “Mayola Manor” as a permanent living situation, nor would we have wanted it to be. The sale of the house was a disruption, though, and a reminder of the various ways that real estate and economics drive our domestic lives.

Subsequently, the key engagement of improvisation in my work is that it allows the temporal conditions of any live performance to have a greater influence on the form and condition of the work. "," “‘Níl’ ‘abair’” is a continuation of a series of ongoing developed improvisational performances which has at its center not only the impossibility of revisiting the live performance but the added condition of the temporality of improvisation.  "," The original work, “abair,” performed as a site-specific response at An Gailearaí gallery in Gweedore, Donegal, considered the place of the <em>Gealtacht</em> in the contemporary art world. It has been pursued through “anarcheological blog” by VSK, “Poetry in Process” at Mater Dei and “Environmental Utterance” at University College Falmouth. At the Béal Festival in Dublin in November 2012, it was considered through the erasures of accretion as the materials of re-performance impinged upon the original. The dynamic of Robert Ashley’s work, a central influence on this year’s Béal Festival, further skewed or elucidated the original performance of “abair.” "," The performance used projection, soundscape, drawing and writing as modes of investigation. For the performance at the Béal Festival, the materials accrued during its previous explorations were presented in the form of a pre-existing short film, mixing the sound and concrete poetry which functioned as a score for its first manifestation, with additional footage of materials relating to the original process of composition used in its second form. Images of temporal context were added during its third form, along with material relating to formal academic critique from its fourth shape.

I am a poor janitor from Harlem and each night as the world slumbers I, and countless other anonymous workers, perform obligatory rituals of labor: cleaning tenement hallways and banks lobbies, office buildings and backyards in a cycle of endless repetition. But tonight, something strange and wonderful is happening for me as I clean the Department of Art at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. In this quiet, academic context, right around midnight is where I discover new registers of cultural meaning that help me to transform myself from a janitor into an artist through the aesthetization of my labor. "," The performance is set to 1970s soul music, together with a revolving disco ball, both metaphorical references to earlier times and identities. I proceed to spread cleaning compound over the critique room floor; but instead of using my broom in the customary manner, I begin making a series of unexplainable floor drawings. The creative use of janitoral materials at my disposal allows me to experience an inner creativity that not only transforms my subject position from maintenance worker to artist, but blurs the boundaries of labor and provides a cultural paradigm for self-transformation. It was as though Ralph Ellison was referring to me when he said, “If people were going to have a voice in their own destiny then they had to first discover ways of discarding old identities and illusion, because their enlightenment could not come until then.”  "," “‘Round Midnight” combines the service aesthetic with performative methodology to replicate “real world” service acts that blur boundaries between types of labor, but also between people who perform them.

"," 2) An identification with beliefs about the other, or the beliefs that the other has about the capital I. How can they share this fluid identification, this fluid feeling of connection, of support and challenging, without feeling that need to possess themselves or anything?” "," That evening the spectators’ chairs were donated to the public space, situated halfway through the performance.  "," During the second series of actions, the event revolved around a summoning of the surface: “Ten things to do before you die; neotopia at our window.” Looking at something disgusting until the reflex to vomit settles into perverse fascination. The actor came upon asking to receive a used tampon from one of the spectators, then crossing the stage, chewing upon it to spit it out as far as possible.  "," A third series included a cleaning of the exhibition space, the public space, and numerous common organic and artificial objects, with the tongue and a whiskey spray gun; subtitled “chronos likes banana’s”; an immutable rite of Marcel Broodthaers’ grave, with the following quote by Deleuze: “Either ethics makes no sense at all, or this is what it means and has nothing else to say: not to be unworthy of what happens to us” (Deleuze, <em>Logic of Sense</em>).  "," The “Lickture” series serves the transformation of spectacular formats into other forms of choreographic and scripted experiences on sense, without any previous mental construction anticipated. “…it was live, and it was art, not theater. Performance Art also meant that it was art that could not be bought, sold or traded as a commodity.” The individual—being a source of action in most relevant economic transfers—defines his/her abilities to execute any voluntary type of movement, in order to achieve his/her desired outcome.

The slow, process-laden work of dyeing, printing and making is echoed in the repetitive and never-ending work of restoration. "," The impromptu and unstaged nature of these performances, where there is no official audience apart from the participants, reveals the quiet, persistent work of restoration. Evidence of successful restoration work is revealed over years, or even decades. The citizen volunteer is not motivated by instant reward or public esteem; rather, their urgency stems from a desire to act before it is too late, to curb loss and its subsequent grief. It is an act of hope, and the repurposing of weeds into functional garments seeks to articulate this tension between restoration and degradation. The garments, worn by volunteers as pseudo-uniforms, activate the space between worker and creek, human and action, thereby heightening the purpose and intention of the act of restoration.

Focusing on topics such as authenticity, interconnectivity, struggle, love, political and social habits and their relation to the Self, the exhibition showcased works of 31 international artists—some established and some emerging, all pioneers—to trace the still-vivid past and current tendencies in the field.  "," In the 30 rooms and two major halls of 17th century Venetian Palazzo Bembo, performances from mid-day until late-night allowed the numerous audiences to interact with the space and the artists in action, which contaminated and transformed the Palazzo through the course of the week, generating an art factory climate. Working in cooperation with cultural institutions, the project further promoted a series of workshops and seminars on performance art issues in Venice and abroad. For this first edition, students of the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice had been invited to present their works related to the topic, and an open fringe section for young international performers was inaugurated.  "," Exhibiting artists were chosen for works—live or documented—that used personal experiences to evoke life itself, the condition of existence, and which generated reflection in the ephemeral interspaces of the “here and now.” Since the artist’s own body was often a primary medium, the event had to step beyond conventional borders of exhibiting and presenting. Both artists and audience, engaging directly, became responsive to each other through a temporary common ground, making it possible to position themselves empathically: everything became matter, of process and presence.

There was also a large safe embedded in one wall. The premise was based on duration; I would perform for up to four hours per day for seven days. For me, this was an especially innovative way of working, as it’s unusual for me to have this amount of time to perform. I usually plan a performance in its totality; on this occasion I made the work as I went along. The process became episodic, a series of revelations about the materials, much like making a drawing.  "," The hair was placed in separate bundles filling the safe. I began by pulling one strand out at a time, laying it on the floor on the opposite side of the room until several strands formed a line. Then, I placed one end of a bundle in my mouth and pulled it from the safe until it fell onto the floor. I dragged it, dropping one end from my mouth to one side of the room, lining it up using my index finger to tread along the hair as I went, ensuring each end reached the wall. I repeated this until all the hair was on the floor, resembling a ploughed field. I stood by the safe looking, as if at the horizon, at my next task, which was to spread the hair out, gently forming a carpet covering the floor. "," Once I completed this task, I pulled a single strand at a time from the nearest hair to the safe, wrapping it around my hand, forming loops, and placing them on shelves until each shelf had small lined-up treasures of hair. I then used my head to sweep the carpet of hair up against the far wall until it was all gathered. I picked up one end and dragged it all back into the safe. Once secure, I had to reach back for one amount of hair, which had remained on the floor. The hair in the safe had attached itself to the sequins on my dress and so as I pulled away it resembled a living organism trying to hold on. Eventually, I managed to reach the hair on the floor that I added to the safe, and after disentangling myself, I closed the safe doors and left the room.

My back became the receptacle of videos alternating between landscapes, naked bodies, violence, food, information, urbanism. In the silence, armed with an accordion, I work on the breath that escapes in singing. The image influences the rhythm of my breathing. The question is asked: how does the world that surrounds us force our body and condition us, without us even realizing it?  "," The performance is done a second time, but the accordion no longer appears sufficient: it is necessary to write for this body. So a working group is created, and thus is born the character of Roussalka, an aquatic goddess. She seeks to encapsulate a sensation: “Dive / Into calm and limpid waters / Or in the tumult of an agitated ocean’s waves / But to immerse myself / Immerse myself completely, right away / That the water may purge me.”  "," The water is her refuge, the place where she can tell her story. In a half-sphere of plexiglass, you can observe her naked body, observe her slightest movements and continue to use her as a screen for the videos. The water brings new possibilities and limitations. The arrangement makes any attempt at a “natural” performance style impossible. The text is voluntarily fragmented: spoken, recorded, projected. The videos are printed on her body, but also above her and her bubble, like traces of dreams and fears. "," A dialogue is established between the actress and the different media. Each element present reveals an aspect of Roussalka. The sound is continuously present, sometimes so faint that it becomes inaudible. Noises, melodies and ambient noise alternate, constraining or accompanying the actress’s voice. She alternates between “I” and “she,” creating distance with the double that is none other than herself, who speaks despite her and over whom she cannot always exercise control.  "," Dreams, memories, confessions, anger. Different levels of reading combine in order to hear these <em>débordements</em> (overflowings), that vanish into a song when speech can no longer liberate Roussalka.  "," In development since 2008.

Charles Di Meglio declaimed the texts by himself, in Parisian churches lit by candles, in a presentation reminiscent of the Baroque oratorios.  "," The show is part of a three-episode cycle: launched in October 2012 with Saint Augustine’s <em>Confessions</em>, it is followed by the narration of the Nativity in December 2012, and will end in March 2013, with the Passion in the Gospel according to Matthew.

In this case, the performance is conceived not as a power game in which the sexes are in opposition, but as a loving game between a couple, where both are in agreement. In this sense, the starting point is the same as EXPORT’s, but whereas she invokes political feminism, this version is irreverent, ludic and funny. I am driven like a dog through the public space, secured by a strap, and I follow obediently the footsteps of my partner. This action is part of a series of interferences/performances, according to the “aesthetics of the disturbance,” an innovative concept of performance art that I innovated.  "," The city is a place with intense social conditioning, producing a kind of numbness of life. Therefore, it is logical that interference aims straight at the inflection of art in the urban sphere. The idea is to install unexpected, strange, undermining micro-elements that attempt to break and dislocate ordinary daily life. In the city—the embodiment of every regulatory discourse—”The Happy Dog” is an interference that tries to shake off the inertia of trivialization of human behavior, not to transform reality but to create crevices, open gaps and to “parasite” reality’s rational and restrictive fabric.  "," “The Happy Dog” was performed in the context of the Festival de Artes do Corpo FAC, a festival focused on re-performance works, relational art and reuse of cultural products in contemporary art.

The choreographic work is performed in relation to a modular architectural form consisting of a six-foot-long interactive operating table and four large wooden leaves. When assembled, the five pieces form a 14’ x 10’ performance surface resembling a banquet table with openings for the insertion of bodies and protrusion of body parts. The central operating table contains an embedded interactive screen that generates surgically-parsed visual texts (in response to a series of custom-designed, printed codes) that are simultaneously displayed as a larger projection.  "," Adapted from a more extensive work-in-progress, “atom-r: The Breaking Wheel” was enacted as a site-specific performance for Opening The Black Box, an exhibition addressing and memorializing reported cases of torture by Chicago police. For the context, the work incorporated choreographic and textual responses to the archives of the Chicago Torture Justice Memorials project, an essay on solitary confinement as “slow-motion torture,” and descriptions of the apparatus at the core of Kafka’s short story, “In the Penal Colony.” Coinciding with the winter solstice on December 21, 2012, the work used a 101-minute slow durational structure, beginning at sunset and ending at nautical twilight, to create a ceremonial homage to the broken body.

PETERSON "," Certain socialized, public spaces emphasize the increasingly blurred distinction between public and private aspects of life. In places like bathrooms, locker rooms and changing stations, individuals share the common activity of removing clothing—is this the body’s vulnerable nature? While participating in a social activity, actively experiencing a common action, the structure of these places (divided stalls, curtains, etc.) allows for a certain amount of privacy and anonymity. It doesn’t take much, however (a loud sound/conversation), to remind us of the tenuousness of this privacy due to the proximity and presence of others. Our experience is seldom, if ever, “ours” alone. From a nude stranger one shower stall away, to a garment worker sewing jeans in a factory half a world away, our lives are inextricably bound to others.  "," While clothes shopping, I took potential purchases into the fitting rooms of clothing stores—Kohl’s, Sears, J. Crew, the Gap—in shopping malls. While wearing the store’s clothes in the dressing room, I read aloud from a poem, “An Attempt to Index the Origins of My Clothing.” This “quadruple sonnet” is a list of the countries of origin of the clothing I own. Reading this aloud, I hoped to bring to attention more mindful consumption practices, as a reminder to myself, and any other consumers within earshot, in such a place designed to emphasize personal “reflection” (in the physical sense, the mirror) over social reflection.  "," The poem’s strict pentameter allows for various enjambments. Perhaps emphasizing the distance between the conditions of the garment’s production and consumer’s purchase? For example,  ","<blockquote>Myanmar, USA, USA, Chi</blockquote>","<blockquote>na, China, Korea, India, Chi</blockquote>","<blockquote>na, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Mauri </blockquote>","<blockquote>tius, China, Mauritius, Jordan, China, </blockquote>"," Bonding materiality of language to the clothing, I cut out each stanza into the shape of a t-shirt on a piece of paper. The back of the paper reads, “where am I from?”  "," This performance implicates me in the consumer process, revealing my own practices, and distances’ blindness. Our clothes protect our bodies, provide a sense of style, keep us warm. Clothes are also a thin membrane that provides proof of our connectivity, our engagement in a global economy that provides protection and wealth for some, exploitation and further suffering for others.  "," After reading each stanza, I placed the poem in the pants’ pocket and returned the un-purchased article back on the store shelf. My hope is the future owner of the pants may find the poem.
