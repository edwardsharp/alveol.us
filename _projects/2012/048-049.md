“To leave a mark” is a 34-minute long video projection, in which five performances are presented. My piece is a questioning of the concept of _in situ_, through which I explore the liminal aspect of the space (the New City Gas building in Montreal) and its intrinsic qualities: motley and disused. This building dates back to the end of the 19th century and played an important role in Montreal’s industrialization, carrying gas to the different boroughs. Nowadays, it holds various purposes, such as movie set, dance space, poetry night, etc. This place therefore was, for me, filled with a priceless historical richness as the basis for my video-performances. My performances were built around objects that were lying around the space (for instance, the huge industrial wood coil) and the particularities of the space (the second floor allowed me a perfect overhead shot).

“To leave a mark” is a video composed of two mirrored shots, which allows the viewer to see the same performative action from two distinct points of view. The two shots are then juxtaposed, but a slight temporal shift between them breaks the linear quality of the action’s narrative.
