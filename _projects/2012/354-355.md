I developed this performance art with the group Bbeyond in St. George’s Square. Influenced by the economic problems affecting the world, I decided to use pennies (the smallest UK coin) as material. In the beginning of the performance, I started to paste the coins onto a public light post, and then added a couple of toy arms creating an “economic golem,” a monster without vision that only attracts more money to himself in times of greed. Upon completion of the golem, I decided to bandage my eyes, blocking my vision/blinding myself. I sat on a bench and in order to decontextualize the money as a commodity of value, I started throwing the pennies like breadcrumbs, like feeding pigeons in a park.
