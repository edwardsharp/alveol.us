Jamming, as the act of improvising with others, is simply paying attention and reacting. During any dynamic and extended jam, there is a point where the limits of a preexisting language run dry and true invention becomes the only option. Reaching this point is a main goal within all of my work and finding a way to align that with a compulsion toward a personal numerology that focuses on multiples of four led me to a piece wherein I performed improvisational music with 48 people over the course of the full 24 hours of the 12th day of the 12th month of the 12th year of the current millennium.

Beginning at midnight, I remained awake, and primarily on stage, for the entire day, and performed until the following midnight for both a live audience and a live-streamed one. The combination of ever-shifting accompaniment, extended performance, exhaustion and a constant audience in a regular performance space allowed me to reach a point where I was forced into the invention point for the majority of the day and then to, eventually, pass that point and investigate what happens once invention recedes.
