The performance took place in a paper room designed by the architect Cédric Libert. On a table, I aligned a sequence of spherical fruits. A bottle of water was open and drunk throughout the performance. I considered the water bottle as a time marker. As long as there was still water in the bottle, the performance was happening. With a knife—which was also a sculpture—the fruits were cut in order from the smallest to the biggest.

I was spurred to do this performance when I started to reflect on the influence of the title in relation to the action. I wanted to create performances that could be resumed by a single statement or a single image.
