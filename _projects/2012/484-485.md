	“residue” is….

	to be open and available

	to past, present and potential future impulses

	individual and layered 

	from deep within 

	and out in the air surrounding

	manifesting 

	as a hint of memory

	as a remnant of image

	as a whisper of feeling….

	as a hint of what is perhaps to come

An improvisation-based performance project in two segments, “residue” is inspired by _pentimento_, an underlying trace image in a painting that has been covered over, reflecting the artist’s change of mind; and _engram_, the hypothetical way a memory is thought to be encoded in the brain.

A two-minute photo slideshow is continuously looped on nine iPads as a performance prelude, carefully cradled, displayed and offered to audience members and passersby throughout the theater lobby via chaperones. Like a memory stuck on repeat, drifting in and out of focus, a mysterious figure in white might be falling, or jumping, or both or neither.

A solo is performed live with spontaneous choices in movement, sound, lighting and costume unfolding each night, creating a unique experience with every viewing and embodiment. The visual landscape consists of a 25 foot-long trail of large-scale tracing paper initially dragged in from the audience to the stage, 12 pairs of shoes carefully aligned, a red purse and an elaborately elegant dress made almost entirely out of paper. The movement, landscape, costume and performer progressively de-construct, de-organize and de-compose over time. The performance evokes a temporal state of curiosity, discovery, loss, transience and revelation.
