As the third and final performance in the Needs Series (following “Hunger” and “Thirst,” both 2011), “Shelter” is also durational and sculptural. Now, however, the formerly twinned-artists each perform a different but related act. One woman sits at a solid table, piled high with small stones. She considers, perhaps counts, and drops each one to the ground. A second woman, with a matching wooden table and chair strapped to her back, attempts to drag an overstuffed bag of stones across the length the space. Both women wear mirrors around their necks that demand that they finally face themselves as they perform these seemingly senseless, endless, yet poignant, tasks. There has been a shift; yet, the search continues for each woman, in her own way.

“Hunger” and “Thirst” each, by definition, denote a lack. The performances indicate this void, even as the women work together, connected. However, “Shelter” emphasizes a need being met. A protection has been provided, but is it enough?
