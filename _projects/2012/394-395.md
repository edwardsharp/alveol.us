For “Bound and Rebound—a ‘post’ performance,” the artist rolled a ball-like form, made from found postal elastic bands and keys—collected over a number of years during urban wanderings—between Castlefield Gallery and BLANKSPACE, Manchester. Made with an interest in the meditative potential of collection and repetition, for the duration of this performance the object was re-turned to the environment of its origin: the street. The journey between the two galleries was made periodically, for the duration of the event, following a circular route. Any postal elastic bands or keys found en-route were added at either gallery. The object was displayed inside each gallery during the interval between each stage of the journey. This live and interventional work created its own audience/participants through chance interaction, connecting the outside public space of the streets with the inside institutional setting of the gallery.
