 THE END, LIGHT BLUE 
 EVE ESSEX &amp; JUAN ANTONIO OLIVARES 
 Drawing from the possibility of translation between image and sound, we created a visual and text-based score inspired by post-production foley techniques. With the consultation of Marko Costanza, a veteran Hollywood foley artist (<em>Brokeback Mountain</em>; <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em>; <em>Ice Age</em>), cinematic sound effects are reinterpreted as a system of musical elements. 
 Ten performers cycle through a variety of roles ranging from quotidian gestures to highly choreographed musical events. Everyday sounds are meticulously recreated by a small ensemble of instrumentalists; physical actions are dramatically and rhythmically amplified. A series of seemingly senseless events cue reactions within the group, in an evolving and organic accretion of sound.
