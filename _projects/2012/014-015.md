A writer and a speaker sit down to address an audience. The writer types at a desk on a computer and her words are projected onto a wall or screen. The speaker speaks through a microphone. The audience listens and reads. Subject matter is open and improvised, seeking a “presentness” of language that is fluid and porous, connecting eye and ear and mind. It is a meditation on the movement and reception of information, on how we “read” ourselves, each other and the world. Each performance creates a collaborative poem/document of the writer’s work. Also performed at AS 220 (Providence, RI), and as a 12-hour long performance at Reverse Space (Brooklyn, NY).
