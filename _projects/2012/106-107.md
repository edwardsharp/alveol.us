Through transmutation and alchemical confection, “Blood and Gold” was an experiment in making the immaterial concrete, a physical manifestation of the soul. At the center of the work is my cake, a bodily stand-in comprised entirely of egg whites, sugar, my blood and 23k gold. Over the month of April, the gallery served as a laboratory. The cake was melted down, fermented and distilled into rum, an extraction and refining of the literal spirits trapped within the crystalized structures of the corporeal pastry.

Visitors to the gallery, Julius Caesar, were able to observe the process and engage with me during regular hours, but the performance continued whether or not a large audience was present in the space.

I have an endless fascination with the economy and commerce of the internal and external self. This manifests in my work as an exploration of the tenuous connections between anatomical tissue, cultural identity and the labor required to produce divine experience.
