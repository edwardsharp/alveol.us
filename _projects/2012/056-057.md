Reading poetry under water expresses the conflict between the modern lifestyle and all the subtle things that come from inside.

Scenario of performance: in the middle of the shopping day, I climb inside a huge aquarium that stands in one of the biggest supermarkets in Lithuania and try to read my poetry.
