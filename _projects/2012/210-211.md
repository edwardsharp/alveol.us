“Guerrilla Gowns” is a silent, orchestrated performance in which nine women wearing white wedding dresses unexpectedly enter a public space. The women come together to crouch down and give birth to objects. The objects chosen were selected by the women in the performance for all women to represent our broken dreams, our living dreams, our lives. In this performance, the artists create a metaphoric event and engage femininity with a contemporary, quiet approach. The event symbolizes a woman’s ability to dream and to manifest dreams transforming our past, present and future by tapping into a liminal state between thought and action.

“Guerrilla Gowns” was also performed at the Honoring Women’s Rights Conference at the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas, CA, an event organized by the Women’s Caucus for Art. It was also performed on September 8, 2012 and in Huntington Beach, CA in front of the Huntington Beach Pier on November 11, 2012 and documented by KCET’s Artbound. Additionally, there is a “Guerrilla Gowns” performance scheduled for the Bound exhibit at Phoenix Gallery in February of 2013. It is an event juried by Cora Rosevear, Associate Curator of MoMA and organized by the Women’s Caucus for Art.
