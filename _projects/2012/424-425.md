A bag is carried around the space, then the bag is opened to reveal its contents. I lay down in the melting ice. The rhythm of my respiration punctuated the action. When I can no longer endure the contact with the ice, I move onto my side and drink directly from the soaked wet bag. The performance took place at the event Nord Performance, questioning the representation of nordicity. The overall concept of “nordicity,” created in 1960, refers to the perceived, real or even imagined condition of high-latitude regions. It deals with a large variety of issues taken from both the natural and the human worlds that may lead to the combined understanding of facts, ideas and interventions of these northern lands.
