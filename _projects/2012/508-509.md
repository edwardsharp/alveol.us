In “Kattywampus,” the viewer witnesses a dysmorphic hero as he struggles to understand why he is the way he is—and why the way he is is wrong. Wearing a large replica of my own head, I strive to present a visually compelling movement piece inspired by Japanese Butoh. Embracing sculptural aesthetics rather than dramatic conventions or dance vocabulary, “Kattywampus” blurs the boundaries between task-oriented functionality and structured ritual. Commissioned by the curators of the Venice International Performance Art Week, the piece featured live improvised sound (guitar) by Lee Wen. Bridging pre-established disciplines with performance art, I began by drawing a large circle on the wall with plaster casts of my fingers—my real digits blackened with ink as if they were missing. Unable to easily breathe or see, my movements were sporadically interrupted by the involuntary desire to pull a colorful organ/egg from my belly. Often re-worked, “Kattywampus” was modified and tailored for this specific venue/location.
