“Milk is a Mother’s Idea” is a dance where I rediscovered making dances for three people. My problem was that I had been making dances for one or two people and had gotten into habitual ways of formulating movement systems. In making a dance for three, I looked at corporeal qualities of inclusion, isolation, unison and anonymity. I became enamored of the mechanics of how these bodies worked as three together. My outcome was reminiscent of bodies in dimly lit locations, in expanses of suburban spaces and most importantly in the scattered inhabitance of parking lots. I found myself reaching into the adolescent fascination with parking lots as a place for freedom, euphoria and social deletion.

The dance was a tight, romantic yet removed structure, somewhat absent but aware of the voyeur. We were exploring an “I don’t give a fuck” attitude with our bodies. I specifically think we explored this in sections where we held each other in strange places, lifted odd parts of each other’s bodies and touched with privacy, somewhat uncomfortably. The intimacy was more like teens exploring one another in the back of a car where clumsiness overtakes the emulation of a sexual act. “Milk is a Mother’s Idea” was first named “MIAMI.”
