Four glasses of milk on the table. Although they look identical, one of the four contains a sleeping pill melted inside. Three audience members are invited to drink a glass of milk with meâ€”eventually making one of us fall asleep.

The glasses are half full/empty. The sleeping pill used for this work is one that is sold in any pharmacy around, with a note on the package describing that it is not harmful to take this amount, one pill. Before choosing, the position of the glasses are shuffled by the public so that it is impossible for me to know which glass is the one with the pill.
