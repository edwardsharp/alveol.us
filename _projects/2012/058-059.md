“False Summit” was a site-specific installation that evolved through creative action over a period of two weeks. Created for 100 Years of Performance Art, a traveling exhibition comprised of documents from performance art pieces made in the past century, we questioned the relationship between experiential art and the ways in which it is archived. In “False Summit Phase 2 (This is an archive of…),” we spent two hours recreating art actions that we had witnessed through our work with The Present Tense.

Live art lives in the memories of those who experience it. By recreating the actions of others with our own bodies, we create a physical memory of these actions. The pieces that inspired each action are now archived into the totality of our beings.
