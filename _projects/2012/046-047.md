“I want more” was an interactive performative exercise that asked the audience to consider the action of asking for more. Inspired by the initial curatorial prompt of offering a soup kitchen for artists, I chose to explore the idea of class structure and the power dynamic of desire, and asking for more, and whether the want is social, economic or abstract.

I chose to stage a lunch where each person’s meal was scaled down to a miniature version of a balanced lunch. Artist-visitors were required to raise their ‘hand’ (an edition of 100 wooden cut-out hands with the text ‘I want more’ branded on each), then amplify their voices by speaking through a megaphone to ask for more food in order to get a fair serving. Using the wooden hand as a starting point, attendees were encouraged to engage with each other and consider what s/he as an artist might want more of; perhaps more inspiration, support, dialogue or attention.

What I find most curious about this project is an individual’s process of recognizing when s/he desires, what it is s/he wants more of, and subsequently how and why s/he eventually chooses to make her/his desire known in demanding satisfaction.
