_Buster Keaton is a silent movie actor. Buster Keaton is a word in Jack Spicer’s poems. Jack Spicer’s language is dictated to him by a Martian. Philip rides by on a scooter. Everyone screams inside the vestibule. Red balloons fall down the stairs as everyone waltzes. Somebody quotes Cocteau and invents a new alphabet. Christian and Kyla listen to voicemails on their cell phones and speak what they hear. Twelve people stand in their underwear in a kiddy pool. They perform a complicated symbolic dance. The audience sits on tires. Distant actors mingle with unsuspecting biologists behind an illuminated glass wall at dusk. Someone rides by on a bicycle._

Federico García Lorca “translated” Buster Keaton’s silent films;

Jack Spicer “translated” Lorca’s play;

We “translated” Spicer’s two poems and got “BUSTER KEATON’S RIDE BUSTER KEATON RIDES AGAIN.”

Each translation is a shadow of the text that preceded it.

“BKRBKRA” is our own correspondence with Spicer and, before him, Lorca: it is an ongoing obsession with challenging the limits and possibilities of language itself.
