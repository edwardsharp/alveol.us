 BOTANICA  
 JIM FINDLAY 
  I.  
 250 living plants.  
 3 living humans.  
 1 performance terrarium.  
 20 gallons of water per day.  
 1 bag of chicken manure per week.  
 53 liters of oxygen created every hour.  
 II. <em>Plant.</em> 
 Container of universal consciousness.  
 Conduit of messages from distant quasars  
 encoded in photosynthetic cells. Receptive biorhythm mechanism for skirting the  
 space/time continuum. The watcher and receiver.  
 III. <em>Plant. </em> 
 Sexual and erotic object. Erogenous system of fecund roots and beckoning  
 leaves. A closed structure of unquenchable desire. The unattainable one. That 
  which can never be properly fucked.  
  IV. <em>Plant.</em> 
 The great destroyer. The dispenser of judgment. The annihilation of creation.  
 The transformation of all matter in its own perfected image.  
 V. <em>Plant.</em> 
 I am going to burn down the world. I am going to tear down everything that  
 cannot stand alone. I am going to shove hope up your ass. I am going to turn ideals to shit. I am going to reduce everything that stands to rubble and then I am going to 
  burn the rubble and then I am going to scatter the ashes and then maybe  
 someone will be able to see something as it really is.  
 VI. <em>Ilan Bachrach, Chet Mazur, and Liz Sargent.</em> 
 18 weeks in the terrarium. Probes, cameras, triggers, signal generators.  
  Watering. Pruning. Listening to the plants. Waiting for a message.  
 Inhalers of spores and munchers of dirt. The test subjects. Detritus.
