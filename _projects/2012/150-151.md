“The Month of Performance Art-Berlin (MPA-B)” is a yearly and month-long open platform, whose central focus is the promotion, dissemination and support of independent and contemporary performance art theories and practices existing in Berlin. “MPA-B” was founded in 2011 with the objective of exposing and interconnecting the work of hundreds of performance artists and facilitators working at the fringe of institutional performing arts, by showcasing and promoting a broad range of activities including performances, workshops, lectures, site-specific actions, happenings, public interventions and unique audience encounters and interactions. Running on the voluntary work of a small organizing team of curators, performers and producers, joined every year by dozens of program partners who respond to an open call for contributions, “MPA-B” is a collaborative structure whose main objectives can be summarized as follows:

Over the years, “MPA-B” has evolved into a wider-reaching entity also active in areas such as network and project development, national and international collaboration, artist mobility and the facilitation of new models and strategies of making and thinking about performance art. For its third edition due in May 2013, “MPA-B” will unveil a new Curatorial Collaboration Initiative (CCI) made of an alliance of 20 independent national and international curators, set up with the aim of facilitating and stimulating initiatives, strategies, contributions and encounters exploring and confronting models and methodologies of curating, producing, promoting, sustaining, creating, making, understanding and talking about performance art. Projects stemming from the CCI, which will include the drafting of a Curatorial Live Art Manifesto of Best Practice and a three-day conference, will form the core of the MPA-B 2013 programming.
