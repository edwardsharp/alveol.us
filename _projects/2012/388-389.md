On the 120th anniversary of the birth of one of the most important writers from former Yugoslavia and the only winner of the Nobel Prize for literature (1961), Ivo Andric´ , at the place where you can still feel and hear his steps—the Wreath of Andric´  in Belgrade—I wrote a letter to the famous writer. While writing this letter, I invited Belgrade, the visitors of the city, friends, known and unknown, intentional or accidental passersby, to join me to write a sentence or two—“letter, with messages…” for Andric´ , with love and respect.
