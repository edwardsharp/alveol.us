“A SINT YOU WANT: 21st Century Sint & Piet“ by artist/performer G. Holwerda (Sint) and with dancer, T. Körtvelyessy (Piet) was performed as part of LAUGH-UP STAND-UP!: ANTI-RACISM HUMOR FESTIVAL, Whose Afraid of Black Women?: Blackfacing Here and Now, at Shedhalle in Zurich, Switzerland. This performance included songs and movement relating to characters, and sweets & posters given to audience by ‘Piets’, and audience members chosen to read “Tops 5 Kids Q’s to 21st Century Sint” (which ‘Sint’ answered).

This performance was part of collaborative projects, begun in 2010, by performer/visual artist/poet Gloria Holwerda. These multidisciplinary projects ‘flip-da-script’ on: current Dutch characterizations of Sinterklaas and his assistant(s) the racist character Zwarte Piet/Black Pete, contemporary portrayals of blackface, and the predominate ‘white’ and ‘male’ portrayals of Sinterklaas and similar figures. G. Holwerda performs with 21st Century Piet(s) (one or more dancers, performers, artists, or children). “A SINT YOU WANT” included public performances, posters, and a ‘21st Century Sint & Piet’ free coloring book.
