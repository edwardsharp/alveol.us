A durational friendship of no more than 24 hours. Please contact me if you’d like to participate. Guidelines below:

1. The two parties engaging in the friendship will have minimal prior knowledge of each other.

2. After initial contact and agreement, friendship will begin and end in person.

3. Friendship will not exceed 24 hours.

4. There is no minimum requirement of time for friendship.

5. Participants are welcome to walk away from friendship during any point.

6. Any and all activities performed during the friendship will be agreed upon together and any physical contact must be consensual.

7. Participants will be asked not to pursue or maintain a post-physical “online” friendship following the in-person friendship.
