I believe we are all special and we are all unique, and that includes you. It´s your birthday one more time, and you deserve to celebrate the person that you are. Ready or not!

Beatriz Albuquerque invited the audience for a provocative performance in the bathroom of Rooster Gallery in New York City’s Lower East Side. A surveillance camera transmitted the proceedings live, in black and white, to the upstairs portion of the Gallery. The monitor was silent, which served to entice participants to venture into the interaction with the performer. Everyone in the audience, including people of all ages, young and old, enjoyed a royal birthday treatment.

The performance, entitled “Happy Birthday Mr. President,” was a nod to Marilyn Monroe’s famous 1962 address to President Kennedy at a fundraising gala for the Democratic Party at Madison Square Garden.
