	EVERYONE IS A PARTICIPANT IN LIFE

	COME WITH OPEN MINDS & INSTRUMENTS

	3/3/2015

	90 NORTH 11th STREET, 

	WILLIAMSBURG

	REHEARSAL: 2:34pm 

	LEVITATON: 3:35pm

Inspired by past Public Action which combine public assembly, performance, and grand vision, Talibam!, joined by a mass ensemble, attempted to levitate Vice Mediaâ€™s office, personnel, and the building itself into the East River.

Inspired by the FUGS levitation of the Pentagon in 1967, we used the performative action of ridding negative spirits from their point of origin to respond to the way in which diverse communities have been poached, appropriated, glamorized against their will, and forcibly removed.

Sprits of the displaced and dormant creative energies underneath the Williamsburg waterfront communities will regenerate.
