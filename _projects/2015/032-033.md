“The Yellow Umbrella—An Unfinished Conversation” is a performance that involves twelve performers engaging with yellow umbrellas. In this work, the performers all wear white surgical masks and gray dresses. They stand in a row, repeating ten gestures. They hold each gesture for two minutes and then move to the next one in a sequence.

The umbrella is a symbol of protection and resistance. At the intersection of aesthetics and politics, this performance explores how symbolic and situational behaviors impact our perception in regards to specific social movements and activism. It seeks to open a dialogue around how to transform social and political landscapes through embodied gestures, examining relationships between the citizens and the places they live and between what they have lost and what they have gained in social political transformations.
