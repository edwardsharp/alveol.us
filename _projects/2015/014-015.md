“Letter to Senga” was a private exploration—with creative practitioner Lisa Anderson—of the sculptural works of American artist Senga Nengudi, on the occasion of her first U.K. solo show at White Cube in Bermondsey, London.

Our choreographed movements were an integral component of the curatorial premise [RESEARCH] that afternoon, which ventured beyond the usually measured distance of position and interaction accorded to spectators in a gallery/museum context, unless otherwise authorized. We shared time and space [a MEDITATION], we talked, we deepened our intellectual and physical knowledge [on LABOR] and perceptions of those semi-amorphous structures, Nengudi’s wider oeuvre including significant artistic collaborations with artists such as Maren Hassinger and David Hammons. Our limbs and muscles made note of those findings, and enabled through new apertures, opened up for us by shifting our perspectives many times over in relation to those individual pieces. It was an acknowledgement and enactment of privilege granted by Nengudi.
