Dressed in yellow as a mashup of a European dandy and park ranger, Duty Free Ranger holds a wooden box filled with tiny toys and charms. He grants them to passersby, whispering a prayer or telling them about the charm’s secret history. He may have eaten garlic in advance but bad breath brings good news. “DFR” destabilizes and satirizes colonialism, militarism, and complacency via performative public interventions—“fashion rituals” that inspire curiosity and awaken onlookers. The performances connect contemporary cultural expressions, i.e., fashion, with our colonialist history.
