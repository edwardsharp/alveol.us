“Indestructible” was the third performance iteration in a series of performances that began in 2013, with the commitment to convert the rite of passage of my birthdays into artistic procedures that allude to what we know as “memento mori.”

Using food and playful decorative elements that refer to children’s birthday parties, I built a body mass similar to my body to act as an identical silhouette within the performance space. I then destroyed the built object in front of the public. The colorful particles of the object reintegrated with other living and dead materials and ensured a metaphorical immortality, becoming indestructible through the destruction of my representation.
