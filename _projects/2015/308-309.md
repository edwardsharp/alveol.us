“Complex Financial Instruments” is a performance practice that seeks to draw a set of connections between finance, psychoanalysis, sound, and music. Beyond the traditional institutions of psychotherapy and financial advice, we have developed a new therapeutic/aesthetic practice, which, while drawing inspiration from psychoanalysis and finance, departs significantly from both forms.

In this version of the work, two performers (Esther Neff and Casey Anderson) reinterpret an audio recording of a session of “financial analysis” held between G Douglas Barrett (analyst) and Casey Anderson (analysand) held on October 9, 2015. The subject of the financial analysis was, in this case, the analysand’s student debt.
