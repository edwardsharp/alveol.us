“n00se” is a performance which acts, firstly, as a response to the terrorism that people of color, the poor, but, especially Black people have endured since the formation of this country. Wearing a n00se I insert myself into a full array of spaces, commercial, aesthetic, populous and public. The intention of action is not meant to be confrontational. Rather, “n00se” seeks to act as a conduit for community and meaning. I seek to be a receptive presence for those who seek dialogue and understanding. I endeavor to continue to perform “n00se” for a year minimum or until I can no longer bear wearing the rope. Additionally, I will document the performance by making journal entries on a blog: shermanperforms.wordpress.com
