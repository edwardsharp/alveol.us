I made an abstracted Purity Ball inspired by the actual phenomenon started by religious fanatics in 1995. I wanted to address our societal distinctions of sexuality, gender, race, and the absurdity of our roles within them. The performance was also inspired by capitalism-induced sociopathy and the neurosis brought on by continuing to live against Earth and refusing humility to uphold the illusion of humanity.

Baxton played harp, piano, and melodica. Sam handed me dolls I made in custom wedding dresses. I danced with each doll before setting them on the ground. I filled my mouth with various store bought condiments, one for each doll, and on my hands and knees spit a protective ring around each doll. Once a new dance began Sam took the dolls and wrapped them in butcher paper before discarding them into a pile behind her.
