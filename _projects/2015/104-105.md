“Surface Storage (quadruple)” is a parkour through and within a square plane, virtually designed based on an underlying pattern of mountain and valley folds, like in an origami base, running vertically, horizontally, and diagonally. Immersed into this environment, the performer encounters various surfaces—reduced to white color materials, that act as data storage devices. Their shapes and textures remind, recall, and affect. They carry inscribed phantasms and hold folds of memory in their material substance. At the same time, they shape a performance space, becoming an architecture of created experiential reality—a complex relational network of frequencies, forces, connections, and becomings. This choreography is a process of questioning how the body invents itself inside this interiority while decoding the data from various surfaces through responsive movement. The body maneuvers here as an intermediary, retrieving the accumulated, and separating signals from noise.
