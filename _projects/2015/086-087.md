Nominal value is a series of ready-mades, i.e. currency bills in denominations of $20, $50, and $100 (edition of three each) taken out of circulation to explore the relationship between real value, perceived value, and added value through artistic action/performance.

The $100 bill is for sale for the amount of $70, however the work only becomes an authenticated art-work through a series of actions that the buyer has to undertake and that is printed on the bill: i.e. buy a bottle of wine at a value no less than $150, contact the artist and consume the bottle of wine with the artist. At this point the flat currency becomes a fiat work of art by signature of the artist on the currency bill.

The performative aspect of the work is primarily an exchange between the buyer of the art work and the artist. This exchange culminates in a personal encounter during which a bottle of wine is consumed, but can (and has) at times included lengthy email exchanges over multiple months before the actual meeting is arranged and executed. An audience may or may not be present in the final encounter; if an audience is present the focus remains on the dialogue between the artist and the buyer of the art work as an unrehearsed first encounter.
