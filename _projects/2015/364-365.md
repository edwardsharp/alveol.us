“Out And Out” is a durational visual art performance linking New York state’s regional history of textile mills and clothing factories with the artist’s enduring exploration of intimacy, desire, and longing. The political and personal conflate as the woman—equally enveloped and embraced by dozens of men’s white shirt sleeves—reaches through the constraints of gender and class to edge closer to an unconditional connection. How can she, indeed any of us, time and again reach across what needs to be transcended?
