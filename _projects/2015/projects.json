Forty-three students were taken and later, disappeared, leaving behind six persons killed, one of them Julio César Mondragón. The case of Julio César stands out from the rest, because he was skinned alive in the place of the confrontation with a brutality that so far remains unpunished and inexplicable, but that could be read as a message from necro-politics, a message within terror that seeks collective paralysis.","In social media, Julio César’s corpse circulated widely, uncensored, and provoked a collective response of appropriation of the terrifying image. With photomontages, memes, and texts, the image was resignified in different ways but as a sign of resistance from the collective. “They took my face, but today those who demonstrate are my new face” can be read on a banner used in a demonstration, which was at the same time copied and used for another protest. This is my performance; it’s a new version of that banner, it provides a new face.","Each performance made for “They took my face, but today those who demonstrate are my new face” has taken different forms in each context it has been presented­­; gallery spaces, public spaces, and academic venues, but what remains in its essence is the same: I cover my face in thick layers with red mud erasing personal traits and I start blowing a balloon hidden in my mouth transforming the faceless mud. Sometimes I reach out for someone from the audience to blow a balloon given in the beginning of the performance, then I exchange breath as a symbol of life and what keeps us alive. Sometimes in Spanish I ask the audience the name of the student and then I write it on the wall with a pencil. In the end I press my face against the wall or floor, leaving behind the trace of a mud face. I clean myself off of the remaining mud with a wet towel and I get back into my everyday clothing.

How are we touched, how do we witness, and how do we respond to the images of human suffering and injustice that infiltrate our surroundings through screens? When we are bombarded with neverending visual stimulus and information, what it is that still goes unseen and unknown?","Created with two separate casts who did not meet until the first performance, the work has its own unpredictability and inherent sense of the unknown, as well as juxtaposition and splicing between/together of two worlds. Each cast has a set of task-based movements based on exploring the power of the gaze, the safety of darkness and the danger of light and overexposure, the experience of touching without feeling and feeling without touching, and risky experiments with destabilizing the dancers’ centers to generate unknowing.","We further interrogate the correlation between sight, knowledge, and power through exposing the power dynamics of the choreographer/dancer relationship.

Midway through the piece, I call myself on Skype and project this conversation of the performance into the performance.

Where the day flows? Only time.”","In my performance “Only Time,” I have set up a rigid process that unfolds over a long duration of time, but I remain open at every moment to the manifold possibilities of interaction, communication, and exchange with my environment, my audience, and Enya’s eponymous hit song. My first iteration of the performance took place on Library Walk on the UCSD campus, a wide pedestrian path that leads to Geisel Library, about a half-mile long. Dotting the perimeter are eighty-seven 6’ x 6’ concrete platforms that I repurposed as stages. I began on the first platform along the path and improvised a performance to the length of the song, playing out of a boombox I brought along with me. After the song finished, I wheeled a cart full of props, including graduation gowns, a small chalkboard, a bowl, towel, water jug, chair, and a pair of black heels, to the next platform along the path, and improvised a new performance to the same song. I continued this process until I reached the end.","The lyrics of the song beckoned me to accept the contingencies of time; I encountered a Baptist proselytizer, an unwelcoming Queer Fraternity, helped promote Study at Sea and Zipcar, had various passersby return my library books, held “Office Hours” for anyone with questions to ask, performed movement exercises, and rested with sleeping undergrads. When not speaking directly to my audience, I often communicated with them via the chalkboard. I would then wipe the slate clean, to prepare for a new moment on a new stage.","In each iteration of “Only Time,” I ebb and flow with the repetitions of the song, feeling at times inspired, lost, introverted, chatty, and thirsty. Each iteration of the performance has found me in a different place in my life: one time a state of contentment, another mistrust, and another recuperation. At times I feel weighed down by the present, and question the viability of wiping the slate clean. At other times I feel light as air, and feel confident in its promise of moving on. The song has become a vehicle for reflection, and I offer the observer an opportunity to join me in contemplating Enya’s questions. With each new performance, I reflect on where the road has led me, then look down at the path that awaits."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"LetterToSenga120115.jpg","photo_credit":"Ben Westoby Courtesy: White Cube/Adelaide Bannerman","title":"LETTER TO SENGA","first_performed":"first performed on January 16, 2015","place":"White Cube, Bermondsey, London, United Kingdom","times_performed":"performed once in 2015","contributor":"ADELAIDE BANNERMAN / LISA ANDERSON","collaborators":[],"home":"London, United Kingdom","links":[],"contact":"adelaide.bannerman@mac.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"014-015"},"description":["“Letter to Senga” was a private exploration—with creative practitioner Lisa Anderson—of the sculptural works of American artist Senga Nengudi, on the occasion of her first U.K. solo show at White Cube in Bermondsey, London.","Our choreographed movements were an integral component of the curatorial premise [RESEARCH] that afternoon, which ventured beyond the usually measured distance of position and interaction accorded to spectators in a gallery/museum context, unless otherwise authorized.

Memory. Sight. Love.” It was my attempt to love through the work.","The performance was about an hour in length. In the first half, five dancers move through rigorous and exacting structure—consisting of geometrical spatial patterns, cyclical counting systems (4-4-3-6-6-3-3-4-1-repeat) and minimalistic movement vocabulary—that develops over time. One of the dancers continuously jumps in a constant speed to provide the beat for the other dancers to count. The jumper’s breath becomes audibly heavier as the piece progresses. It is as if the dancers are each a part of a larger system of machinery, and their individual endeavors build into a collective one, allowing the machine to run as a whole. They are like a clock, relentlessly and earnestly rotating around themselves and each other. As in meditation, they go through this intense “doing,” in order to reach transparent “undoing.” Around the midpoint, their movements and presence shift into a more pedestrian tone. A soundtrack of three voices casually speaking accompanies this transition. Each voice is from a different location, and they do not necessarily correspond to each other. However, there is skin-felt intimacy in the way they speak. A blue nightgown, shiny hula hoops, a song sang on the guitar… the clock gradually opens up, letting the time inside it flow out. The piece closes with an ambitious solo that weaves through the other bodies standing still onstage with their eyes closed. The solo ends with a dancer jumping again and again, pushing herself to her absolute physical limit.

The simple premise behind this performance was that we read the Executive Summary aloud, in its entirety, in a central and public place on the campus of Ramapo College on Thursday, January 22, 2015.","The summary is 525 pages long. We read it in fifteen hours and seven minutes without stopping, with each performer reading in fifteen minute sections. We averaged reading one page every one minute 43 seconds.

If the many worlds’ interpretation of quantum physics was taken as a given, I would not exist in most realities that came into being after July 1986. This performance was designed as an abstract representation of the feelings associated with that. I divided the performance into four fifteen minute sections: MILK, WORK-OUT, HURT ME, and FALLING. Each section was demarcated using a soundtrack dubbed onto a cassette tape.","During MILK I sung songs in Spanish (my first language) and antagonised the audience by making them help me in and out of my clothes. I alternated between drinking beer and spitting milk out of a carton into a large jar while chanting “in with the good out with the bad.” I attempted to hold an inverted bridge yoga pose for three minutes but could only manage one-and-a-half.","During WORK-OUT I changed into running clothes and did fifteen minutes of intense training, including running in circles, doing push-ups and sit-ups until I collapsed. I transitioned into HURT ME by singing a song by the band The Carpenters. I chose to feature their music heavily during the performance as a commentary on Karen Carpenter’s death by anorexia. I spent the rest of the fifteen minutes writing the phrase “hurt me” on cards, putting them in envelopes, sealing the envelopes with a kiss and handing them to the audience. I made twenty of these cards. I then invited several audience members to attempt to hurt me using props I had in a bag.","During FALLING I smeared my face and body with lipstick and then drank the milk I had spit into the jar during the first act.

We were to drink Arcturan workers’ blood* until we were good and toasted, and then play a delightful card game, the winner of which would become the new owner of the City of Saint Francis, whose name had been Anglicized centuries ago in the last wave of gentrification and displacement.","At key moments in the opening speech/ritual I held up cue cards, to both draw responses from the audience and to give them a feel for their collective personae. The first card was predictable enough, to get them in the rhythm of responding: “APPLAUSE.” However, the rest of the cards got weirder and more specific, including “SIGH OF ENTITLED CONTENTMENT,” “GRUDGING MUMBLES OF RESPECT FOR MY ELOQUENCE,” and “MENACING GROWL OF CLASS HATRED.” This made the Limonauts laugh a little as they complied and performed these moments, and helped them to develop the malevolent ruling class characters they were improvising during this predatory jaunt about town.","I asked the Limo to stop at one point, and picked up a “casual laborer” on the street to help me deal the cards for the big game. Some Limonauts were uncomfortable for a moment with this development. The laborer was really a “plant” I had enlisted; performance artist Xago Juarez. I wrote and designed the cards that we dealt out; this was a bizarre card game of my own creation in which the half-drunk players could trade galactic resources, commodities, and populations; there were also cards with which they could poison, blackmail, and otherwise betray each other in high neo-Borgian style.","At the end of the ride, just before a winner could be announced, Juarez produced a weapon, denounced the lot of us, and pulled me out of the craft to be held at ransom by the local revolutionary movement.

I have chosen to categorize this performance as “self-curated” (a term borrowed from writer/performer Lee Turner). “on the video” erected an e-wall between performer and observer, tasking them with the same documentation role, but allowed the audience to watch as much or as little of the performance, from the comfort of their own bed. “GLORY GLORY HOLELUJAH” explores and magnifies the performer-observer relationship through a semipermeable membrane, and places upon a porcelain throne our search for gratification."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"vdl_research_house_ii.jpg","photo_credit":"Milan Zrnic","title":"VDL RESEARCH HOUSE II","first_performed":"first performed on January 31, 2015","place":"PG4S AT VDL Research House II, Los Angeles, CA","times_performed":"performed once in 2015","contributor":"STEPHEN LICHTY / NEIL MARCUS / DAPHNE HONMA","collaborators":[],"home":"Brooklyn, NY / Berkeley, CA / Los Angeles, CA","links":["en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Marcus"],"contact":"neil.marcus@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"030-031"},"description":["The performance took place during the golden hour in modern architect Richard Neutra’s VDL Research House II.

The rooms once occupied by Marx now sit above the restaurant Quo Vadis at 26-29 Dean Street. This contrasts sharply with the area’s reputation when the Marx family resided there, which a Prussian spy surveilling Marx in 1852 described as “one of the worst, therefore one of the cheapest, quarters of London.” The family’s time on Dean street was marked by hardship, including illness and the deaths of three of the Marx children in the home.","“Plaque” plays on notions of the tangential, spurious and transitory in relation to acts of commemoration and monumentalization.

We edited footage from the documentation of a previous performance in which we had painted various objects in golden hues. We used mostly the frames that showed the audience watching us perform.

I chose to use a BOSS calling card to call attention to life in the 1990s–2000s in New York and examine how these cards were a type of immigrant ritual to stay connected to loved ones pre Skype and Facebook. The soil and card are both references to landscape since calling cards are often littered around the streets of Brentwood and Queens after they are used. The conversation was improvised in order to capture a genuine view of our relationship. The phone was amplified so the conversation could be well heard throuhgout the museum. The call lasted the length of the calling card credit which was twenty minutes. I then laid the phone and the calling card in the middle of the crossroads I had made.","Some topics that arose during our conversation were memories of each other, where we’d go when I would finally be able to visit her, an articulation of how distance affects us, how her kids are doing, her next visa application appointment, a tearful apology to each other, etc. Frequently throughout the performance we would say “Hello, are you there still?” since calling cards sometimes have faulty signals.","The space activated by the ritual, and perhaps also by performance art, enabled my sister and I to voice things that for years were left unsaid. I wanted the piece to address the awkwardness of talking on the phone with relatives in other countries that I felt growing up. How sometimes the phone is passed to us by our mothers and how words are sometimes hard to find. We have talked more regularly on the phone and become closer since the time of the performance.

Over time, indulging in this darkness affected my physical and mental health negatively, so I took a break from performing under this nom de guerre for nearly two years. Returning to performance art with this piece, I challenged myself to resurrect this older form of self-presentation while maintaining a sense of control over my identity.","The performance started as I extinguished all the lights in the room and created a runway out of thirty electronic tealight candles. I revealed one of my childhood stuffed animals: a light blue creature named Chiggles, who releases a series of electronic beeps that echo like laughter when activated by touch. In the center of the runway, I dropped to do push-ups, my face pressing into Chiggles, who laughed with each rep.","Afterward, I flipped on a clamp light, flooding the room in a light blue hue. Motivated by a dream where DEAD ART STAR’s ancient demonic spirit appeared to me underneath a mirror’s surface, I peered into a mirror with a flashlight, searching for the demon inside, and found nothing. It was time to resurrect my former persona. I invoked DEAD ART STAR by drawing the demon onto the mirror’s surface with white makeup and gargling cabernet sauvignon, which I slowly spat onto the mirror. I painted my face with thick, crude white marks, therefore embodying him.","I extinguished the lights again, leaving only the candles to light the room. Then I threatened audience members one by one, singling them out by pointing the flashlight directly into their faces as a line from _Night of the Living Dead_ repeated over and over again from an audio recording (“They’re coming to get you, Barbara”).","Once the ceremony concluded, it was time to put the demon to sleep, which I enacted by tucking him under a blanket of wigs. As I rested under the blanket, I clutched Chiggles, who laughed periodically, until the audience realized the performance was over and, one by one, moved on.

Sometimes solutions are not about doing more–but doing less. Less is more. I became the American Idle.","Slow down. We move too fast. I researched and wrote a daily blog for the Franklin Furnace InClimate project and became obsessed with climate disruption. I did some math.

Conceptually we proposed to examine what the strategies for survival might look like when faced with the abject conditions of solitary confinement. Avoiding the didactic, we sought to poetically re-frame the facts behind the effects of isolation within a fictional present and a parallel sci-fi future narrative. Confined to a 2 m x 3 m white delineated space, the average size of a solitary cell, Julie’s movements ventured to illustrate the passing of time by way of examining the details and incremental shifts of the physical body in conjunction with the isolated memory via the text. Environmental sensors located within the space of the pseudo-cell captured the various actions or non-actions. These in turn triggered a relational text stream delivered to a live webpage projected on the wall. The text authored by Julie, mimicked real time thoughts, responses, and actions. Over time the accumulated text started to build into a fictional narrative somewhere between an indistinct present and a speculative parallel future.","We started thinking about this work three years ago. At that time we were drawn to the cumulative details in daily life and the relationship to associative memory. We imagined a prisoner of conscience and their relationship to their diminished world: how tiny shifts within time and space might trigger their own set of personal memory associations. During an artist residency at an old repurposed Police Lock-Up in 2013, Julie spent a day in one of the dim cells with water only and one meal. This tiny gesture, however, had a big impact. The minute glimpse into the reality of what solitary confinement actually means, alongside research and readings of personal accounts became a driving force that shaped the performance. It shifted the focus of our somewhat romantic notion of a prisoner’s diary toward a more harsh and pervasive reality. It was a turning point that influenced the creative writing which is now the fiction within the work. Forced solitary is one way of breaking the fabric of what it means to be human. In “RIMA” we attempted to look not only at the current facts but dared to dream a future world where the lessons of today could be used to envision a paradigm shift."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"LIVEANDLEARNDIEANDFORGETITALL_(1).jpg","photo_credit":"Wayne Kleppe","title":"LIVE AND LEARN DIE AND FORGET IT ALL","first_performed":"first performed on March 21, 2015","place":"Little Berlin, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","times_performed":"performed once in 2015","contributor":"CATHY MCLAURIN","collaborators":[],"home":"Boston, MA","links":["cathymclaurin.com"],"contact":"cathy@cathymclaurin.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"070-071"},"description":["On November 29, 2012, I flew from Boston to Moline, Illinois to attend a three-day firearms auction that included 96 items from my dad’s antique gun* collection, in addition to over 3,000 other firearms, including Eva Braun’s handgun (a gift from Adolph Hitler) and Saddam Hussein’s M-77 Ruger, a war trophy taken from the Presidential Palace in Mosul and later given to a CIA agent as a retirement gift. My dad had decided to sell his 250 antique guns after twelve years of collecting, because, in his words, “I’m getting old and I’m going to die and nobody will know what to do with them.” I called him in North Carolina each night of the auction to let him know how it was going. I recorded those conversations. A common interest—his antique gun collection—was the point from which a conversation could begin and then meander, at times awkwardly, always ending up at the same place.","In a 30 minute unscripted monologue I attempt to make sense of my own relationship to the polarized debate around gun control in the US, while exploring the personal relationship I have with my father.

I ask that as they finish eating the candy, they put their discarded wrapper into a bowl that I have placed on the floor in front of me. I weave a narrative that takes the starting point of the auction. The candy operates as a persuasive device, similar to the way that language is employed in the descriptions that the auctioneer spins to appeal to the bidders in their audience. The narrative gradually incorporates personal details about my father, occasionally interrupted by the audio recordings of our phone conversations. All the while, I am carefully folding the discarded candy wrappers into small origami-like forms, displaying them on a nearby ledge.

In the lecture, Dr. McCabe is demonstrating the difference between the experiencing self and the remembering self, a theoretical concept that explores the ways in which human beings give context for their lives through memory (the remembering self), while simultaneously grappling with who they are in the present moment (the experiencing self).","I started the process of making this solo performance with the intention of telling a story about adoption. I am an adoptive mom. Both my husband and son are adopted, so issues of adoption are very present in my life.

Do I tell my son’s story as he had told it to me (through the eyes of a six year old)? Do I tell the birth mom’s story (which I only know through the adoption agency)? Somehow for me, the experience of adoption seemed to fuse all three, so that in the present moment (the experiencing self), the three perspectives (the first mom, adoptive child, adoptive mom) became one. Each story, each perspective is like a cable wire holding power, meaning and a specific purpose. The wires become tangled causing the feelings that accompany the adoption process—rage, joy, loss and guilt—to crisscross and ignite. Thus the process of making this performance was as much about the physical process of untangling those wires through the revelation of Dr. McCabe’s lecture/story, as it was about the realization that bundling, flattening, and organizing them couldn’t change the unfathomable, shifting logic of the remembering self and the experiencing self."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"BlackBox.jpg","photo_credit":"Cynthia Post Hunt","title":"BLACK BOX","first_performed":"first performed on April 2, 2015","place":"Fayetteville Underground, Fayetteville, AR","times_performed":"performed twice in 2015","contributor":"CYNTHIA POST HUNT","collaborators":[],"home":"Fayetteville, AR","links":["cynthiaposthunt.com"],"contact":"cynthialpost@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"080-081"},"description":["black box","noun.","1. see event recorder.","2. a usually large, square room with black walls used as a space for theatrical performances.","3. a. a device or theoretical construct known or specified performance characteristics but unknown or unspecified constituents and means of operations. b. something that is mysterious, especially regarding its function.","The black box theory of consciousness states that the mind is fully understood once the inputs and outputs are well defined, and generally couples this with a radical skepticism regarding the possibility of ever successfully describing the underlying structure, mechanism, and dynamics of the mind.","This work considers personal loss and a variety of methods used to tend pain.

Then the stone was accepted and taken from my hand. I pulled away and the pantyhose stretched as I reached for another stone. This continued until all the stones were handed to an audience member. Through this act, we became a physically connected network. While the weight of dragging the stones was lifted from my body, I became ensnared. My body was harnessed by the audience. I remained in this tensile state until the first stone was dropped, an inevitable but unpredictable action that signaled the beginning of the performance’s end. I picked up the fallen stone and the others that followed suit. Cradling them in my arms, I did not let the stones fall back to the ground. I held my hand out to take back the stones I had offered to those who did not let them drop.

Participants were “vetted” at the door, asked to sign a waiver written in our native language of binary code, given guiding booklets with supplementary philosophical information, and invited to take part in a series of experiments as both observers and experimental subjects upon whom we tested our hypotheses. We conducted five experimental situations, each taking place within the overarching framework of a philosophical laboratory. Each experiment corresponded to a region on our “Bell Curve of Meaning and Non-Meaning,” which mapped the accumulation and degradation of meaning resulting from repetition over time.","During our “Verbal Satiation Experiment,” participants lied down with their eyes closed as they listened to audio of a recorded phrase on loop. Our “Philosopho-Generative Experiment” asked participants to read and re-read a Hans-Georg Gadamer passage on the subject of repetition, and then enact a circumscribed dialogue wherein one person used scripted questions to ask their interlocutor to repeat and clarify their thoughts.","Our “Meisner Experiment” employed the classical acting technique of Sanford Meisner, using dialogical repetition as a means to observe authentic impulse. This was followed by a reading and discussion of Gilles Deleuze on the “theater of repetition.” In our “Memoryscope Experiment,” participants transformed a simple circle upon a sheet of paper into their very own “memoryscope.” Through a series of instructions, this tool was used as an interface to access memories of the deep or recent past and future.","During our “Mantra Experiment,” participants were placed in pairs to engage in stream-of-consciousness monologues. Everyone chose a phrase from their partner’s monologue, which became a mantra that their partner repeated aloud for a duration.

Each woman solo, pointless and chaotic, explores the possible physical differences. Executed in juxtaposition, or separately, they create the shuffling of the body matter and the cycle of repetition in finite spaces. The immediate memory of each body is erased by an emergent one, generating a new relationship to the space. These dances emphasize the gravity of the space with concentric and eccentric directional choreographic movements toward the audience.

It was conceptualized by Brooks with Valentina, Attilio, and Isabella, with Arianna, Laura, Cleo, Julie, and Cristobal as collaborators. Drawing its dramaturgy from durational artwork, Christian iconography, and contemporary gender theory, “FEMME” viscerally embodies collisions of masculinity and femininity in the structure of a queered crucifixion, with the proposition that a loom can stand analogous to a cross. The Gossip’s heavy cross played on repeat during the creation process, and the arc of a weight, a fall, and a crisis, gave a framework to propose alternative masculinities and femininities. “FEMME” originated from the death of my grandfather, my rediscovery of Lutheran faith, and my own questions on the ethics of trans masculinity.","----","I watched The Last Temptation of Christ in December 2014, two months before rehearsals for “FEMME” started. It was 2AM, and I realized the central image of loom as analogous to a cross was, in fact, a queered crucifixion, and that was the backbone of the piece. This queered crucifixion entered a third space between icons of masculinity and femininity, and forefronted the liminal space between the two. If an atypical masculinity is put on trial by the femme, it is there that reversals and upheavals can exist—with the possibility for transformation, confirmation, or removal of masculinity from the space. Our creation process was framed through devising and collaboration. In the room we understood devising as a collage of text, image, bodies, and design. There was a goal of undoing the rigid hierarchies and constructions of gender, and so it didn’t make sense to reproduce a rigid hierarchy in the rehearsal room—instead; there was a weaving together of being an artist in the room and filling the role designated to you as actor/designer/dramaturg.","Gender and faith are questions that have been orbiting in either their presence or absence my whole life—as well as in the hearts of my collaborators—from a body rejecting the masculine aspects of femininity, to trying to hold onto femininity in my masculine identity. We re-framed these concepts as propositions, and looked to see how they collided, cohered, and evolved.

We take as our material the invisible routines—disciplinary, infrastructural, embodied—that stage this enrollment at the microscale of laboratory interaction. By inverting the agential structure of the experiment, unmooring it from scientific hypothesis, this reflexive regimentation becomes perceptible and actionable. What emerges in the activity of the experiment when, instead of intervening on submissive subjects, the experiment becomes malleable and responsive, conforming to subjects’ impressions of and aspirations for science?","EXPF rearranged materials and practices that are local to the cognitive psychology lab. We recruited subjects using a university’s system for tracking experiment volunteers. We brought them to the lab. They completed a consent form. We brought them into the testing room. They filled out a demographic questionnaire. We had them complete what appeared to be a standard computer-based cognitive psychology experiment. After the “experiment,” we elicited their reflections on the experiment’s purpose and design, culminating in suggestions for how to improve all aspects: questionnaire, instructions, task, stimuli, physical space, and “experimenters.” Our performance score required that we respond to and resolve subjects’ feedback before the next subject arrived, whose impressions revised the experiment for the next subject, and so on, creating an iterated chain of performance and revision. Over the course of the performance, subjects’ feedback required that we modify the experimental task, add images, insert pop music, change the timing, edit the instructions, rearrange the testing room, and begin to wear labcoats to better resemble prototypical scientists. Subjects created experiences that conformed to their expectations of science, expectations that were shaped by the expectations of subjects who came before.

I collaborated with three dancers to construct two perfumes which referenced the geography of “Western Drive.” I made each scent by hand with high quality, perfume-grade essential oils sourced from specific trees, quoting the flora near the road. Dancers scented their bodies, clothing, and hair with Texas cedar and oakmoss in an offstage ritual. The scents were then dispersed as the dancers moved to, from, and through the performance space.","In the performance of “Western Drive,” scent and sound abstractly illustrated the road and its surrounding memories. The performance space was warmed with humidity and dimly lit with a blue jewel tone. An ambient musical score mixed with blues guitar began the narrative to a scattered audience sitting on tree stumps or standing faced in different directions. Dancers entered with the trail of scent of cedar and barely-detectable oakmoss, the first notes of the performance’s perfume, “1351.” In scented choreography, they applied juniper berry, the final aromatic note of “1351,” on exposed skin as the musical score and spoken word provided context of the land. Audial and olfactory landscapes were abstractly painted by the dancers’ scented movement, the fading perfumes on the dancers’ bodies, and the non-fiction story of the rural road spoken by me with accompanying sound score to heighten emotional tones. The audience listened and breathed as the sound and smells shifted onstage. Their inhalations subconsciously embodied the land, its ancestors, and the grounding air deliberately re-created in the poetic, sensory experience. “Driftwood Bonfire,” the second fragrance of “Western Drive,” entered like wildfire at the story’s finale. The smoky smell longed for campfires built by my late grandfather before the property was sold. It symbolized loss, drought, and trauma inflicted upon the land as ownership switched and impermanence prevailed. Once the “Driftwood Bonfire” aroma faded, a sudden realization of mortality arose.

For our performance, we chose to work on the border segment contained within the GM Assembly Center, built in 1985 over the demolished Dodge Main plant. The actual GM plant not only signals the implementation of a mechanized mode of production; its construction also demanded the annexation of a larger territorial base—a dismantling of 1200 homes in Poland Town and the swamping of the Beth Olem cemetery within its grounds. Our chosen segment was termed as ‘inaccessible’ since this particular limit was legally born inside the factory. Its inaccessibility was predetermined by the massive event of the assembly plant; that is, by the limits imposed by the expansion of post-industrial capitalism.","Therefore, we found ourselves in a complex situation: exploring the porousness of inaccessibility. Thus, if a border is inaccessible—meaning it cannot be accessed, traversed, crossed, trespassed, reinforced, marked, or remembered­—what is left of the limit? An inaccessible border is an abstract border, for concrete borders are porous: they face the possibility of permeation. There is no border without the attempt of crossing. How could we cross this border? How could we make it visible? Our performance was very simple: it consisted of tracing the physical border of the GM plant by walking around the perimeter of the factory. The walk was recorded using a gopro camera and a GPS tracking system. The final product was a projection of the video inside a gallery/store in Banglatown, Hamtramck, and a printout describing our reflections on the walk.","So, while my head-camera was recording a view of the plant, I was also being seen and tracked by the guards at the plant. A silent dialog took place here, one that was only possible because there was a border, a fence, and a protocol. Thus, while something was being lost in the process—since the real experience of walking the perimeter was un-transmittable—something else was being produced: an image that was not controlled by our vision (the gopro camera has no screen): a new entity, a body-eye or an unconscious eye that recorded my body as an observation target.

Dubbed “Slugs to Sludge,” the walk was created as a playful way to raise awareness of water conservation in a drought-stricken community and to advocate for action on ecological sanitation on the campus and beyond. Along the way, 80 participants learned about the poetics and politics of human waste as they traveled through several different landscapes that are hybrids of wilderness and human infrastructure.","Organized by FICTILIS and seven undergraduate arts researchers, the event was also staged as a kind of pilgrimage to the commons of the treatment plant, which represents the commingling of the “movements” of the 80,000 people it serves. Participants were invited to speak openly about their bathroom behavior, tell jokes, and play games in an effort to get more in touch with each other and the landscapes we (and our waste products) inhabit. Because the walk began on campus and ended at a public park, it represented a bridging of the campus-City divide that is rare among public events in Santa Cruz.

The dialogue following his speech opens into an experience of the British post-colonial experience of the world and being black in it. A provocative question is posed asking Baldwin where he thinks the black man will be in 50 years time. Baldwin’s answer is optimistic speaking of a black state of mind, a sense of pride that will emerge that would bring forth a new kind of identity.","“Baldwin’s Nigger RELOADED II” reflects on this question posed in our times nearly 50 years from the original speech. It seems in our times that the things happening in the world are not dissimilar to many of the things spoken about in that conversation in 1968. The work of Baldwin, in particular his presently much quoted essay “The Fire Next Time,” seems somewhat prophetic and appropriate to consider where we are socially and politically in this moment in time.

In Hawaii, where water is the organizing principle of its culture, it became impossible to create a relevant response in a black box, proscenium stage, or studio.","We started dancing outdoors, and performed in four different locations: tracing the path of a paved over natural spring in a rapidly developing neighborhood, on the bank of a channelized stream bordering Hawaii’s biggest university, at a pristine private beach, and in the middle of an active harbor on 25 x 25 cm posts leftover from the 2011 tsunami in Japan that stripped a pier of its deck.","Each performance was a different response to the body of water, terrain, and histories of the site. The audience ranged from passersby to invited dance critics; some sites were welcoming, sometimes we were asked to leave. Due to the unpredictable natures of these sites (i.e. a week of storms changed the face of the river entirely), a few of these performances were largely improvised structures of tasks: alter \u0026 unalter the environment / listen to the water in the air / follow the most efficient path which is not direct.","In the one-time culminating performance, “where water meets land,” audiences were bussed to an undisclosed location (we could not get formal permission). On the way, they listened to an audio track created from interviews about water. Arriving at a convergence of land-sea, harbor-airport, development-dilapidation, patrons of the arts and local inhabitants of a neglected neighborhood gathered on the shore. From a distance, they watched performers poised on posts, backed by a setting sun, moving sea vessels, and planes taking off. With pollution rendering the water unsafe to fall into, the six dancers and two musicians negotiated the constantly changing elements: waves, wind, rain, sun, and sea animals before being pulled in by the audience on a remnant of the dock.","Built or found environments changed the language of our movements. Dance became not about moving on a stage, but about being moved by the environment, by its natural and human-made histories.

With this money the public could discuss with me the value of art objects I had built based on the public dreams people had written on my performer’s bodies in 2014 at the same site. The public would then negotiate with me on how much to pay for the sculpture they had chosen. I would then deduct the agreed price from the original check and give them a new check. Each public participant received an authentication form from The Queen of Luxuria. I conducted a great deal of research on the art market for this performance and incorporated actual facts and figures into my individual conversations discussing ideas about how we value art in our lives.

As a genderfluid artist, the idea of a whole, balanced being consisting of both female and male aspects is very important to me, hence my use of triangles and the eye symbol I use which can be shifted to become a womb. The cage I interact with in “Immure” is no exception. In one sense it represents oppression and incarceration; on the other it represents transformation, alluded to by the visual reference to crystals. One observer said it reminded them of Lemurian Quartz. The entering and exiting of the cage is also a reference to life and death, rebirth and enlightenment.

It works in much the same way as Building Sweeps-Harlem did to examine catastrophes of urban decay and apathy by constructing cultural paradigms of care and concern for others. The conceptual approach to this work is simple: take a plane to Japan and set up a camera on a tripod in a fixed location in the waiting room of a mundane bus station in downtown Nagasaki; next, make one photograph each hour on the hour, for twelve consecutive hours, before catching a flight back to Harlem.","The question now becomes, how can a series of performance photographs constitute an investigation of historical tragedy?

Truman, dropped a plutonium-type nuclear weapon on the people of Nagasaki, distinguishing themselves as the only people in the history of the world to use nuclear weapons against other people. The initial blast and firestorm that followed vaporized between 39,000-80,000 citizens, with others slowly dying from burns and radiation poisoning over the years. Genetic effects are prevalent and have inter-generational consequence so devastating that Japanese people had to invent a word to describe these people. They called them: Hibakusha, or “explosion-affected people.” This is a man-made tragedy that affects generations of lives.","Historical memory and time are framed conceptually lest we forget. Twelve hours represents a half-time division of days, where history pauses before it intersects with the future; where time perpetuates itself in continuity. The bus station is a physical metaphor for this space, between the past of where travelers are coming from and the future destination of where they hope to be."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"REAL_NEWS.jpg","photo_credit":"Be Be","title":"REAL NEWS","first_performed":"first performed on August 11, 2015","place":"Nature of Experience Conference, Salem, MA","times_performed":"performed once in 2015","contributor":"GINNY LLOYD","collaborators":["Jennifer Weigel"],"home":"Jupiter, FL","links":["ginnyonline.com"],"contact":"ginnylloyd@ginnyonline.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"212-213"},"description":["A new FluXus score was performed during the Nature of Experience Conference in Salem, Massachusetts.

Your mysterious aura draws me in a spiritual wonderment so I am calmest and happiest when near you. It is tragic how mankind does not respect and celebrate you this way, in this day in age. We are trying to control, deplete, and poison you. I am profoundly sorry.” And a a third read: “Chère eau, Je t’aime. Je t’aime parce que tu es mon symbole de résistance.

It’s about someone walking their dog who encounters people who don’t speak their language. “Maybe you don’t like me / I can’t understand you / Maybe you will like my dog / He’s a labradoodle.” “Uber Driver” combines dark synthy cumbia with soaring reverby vocals: “Let me spend infinity in your Infiniti / Uber driver, don’t take me home.” “Yummy.com” uses the words published on the Yummy.com storefront in Silver Lake: “chicken, eggs, love, yummy yummy yummy, dot com.” Finally, a parody of “Run Away” by Eurodance group Real McCoy: “Run away, run away, run away from Echo Park, run away, run away, run away if you want to make art.

Two technological earth mounds, created using spoil from the Big Dig, filled out the island’s figure. It now resembles an ear.

Thus fully initiated, “Partners” used the space of my body to explore relationships between corporate bureaucracies, family, and networked paths of money and care, all suspended in a period of three months. Each time my body enters Brigham and Women’s Hospital, how differently is my body understood as opposed to that of the son-in-law of Carl J. Shapiro (of the aforementioned Shapiro Cardiovascular Center), who happens to be the chair of surgery there? When I am not in a position to physically access the sites of Emblem Health, how does this change the function of their website and blog? How does the repetition of phone calls, whether made by myself or initiated for the performance, reach a point of saturation? These questions and relationships produced documentation ranging from the drawing included here to copies of my medical records both personally produced and made available by Brigham and Women’s, as well as an essay titled “Smilow.” Ultimately, this performance ended on November 24th, 2015 during an action that took place over two hours: I had a colonoscopy during which an adenoma (an internal growth that develops into colon cancer) was removed. The imaging study initially denied by Emblem Health would not have found this growth. “Partners” created a space in which the inadvertent and unintentional actions of Emblem Health and myself resulted in changed physical conditions and a new understanding of the potentials and differing trajectories of duration."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"Judaica.jpg","photo_credit":"Ben Spatz","title":"JUDAICA","first_performed":"first performed on September 16, 2015","place":"University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield, UK","times_performed":"Ben Spatz","contributor":"Sióbhán Harrison, Jennifer Parkin","collaborators":["urbanresearchtheater.com / hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/cppr"],"home":"Huddersfield, UK","links":[],"contact":"ben@urbanresearchtheater.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"252-253"},"description":["Ben Spatz","The Judaica Project investigates post-Grotowskian song-action through a dynamic work on Jewish cultural materials.

The performer and the facilitator are treated as a part of the whole stage set.","We announce to the audience that the workshop begins with how to become an audience. They are asked to clean up the floor and put stones in the hanging bucket. There is no chair and the performer moves around, so they have to stay standing and walk around so as not to crash into objects or other people. As the performance goes on, the facilitator starts to put or lean objects on various parts of the audience’s bodies, corresponding with the performer’s movements. By doing so, she makes them pay more attention to their own bodies as well as the process of balancing. Accordingly, they are guided to watch the performer’s movements, linking their physicality to hers.","In the end of the performance, the audience is again asked to lay the wooden boards back on the floor and the facilitator lays down under one of the boards.

Through EMG analysis, this sleep movement behavior is shown to occur in rhythmic, percussive intervals.","As an artist who works extensively in signal generation and signal-to-signal response, EMG testing allows for the opportunity to investigate the human variable as both generator and conductor of signal. During the unconscious state, the body performs violently onto itself thus generating rhythmic noise, and in turn the EMG signals communicate these sounds as electronic signatures. My performance involves the translation of these violent actions in the unconscious, registered as electromagnetic signals, with a composition for sound using the very elements of signal to signal response, human movement, and quasi-rhythmic sequencing.","The graphic score consists of test results involving three anonymous patients that were released in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, Volume 08 No 04. The patients—two males and one female—were afflicted with atypical headbanging. All three cases had RMD with atypical headbanging, or head slapping, consisting of head punching and head slapping where the head bangs itself rhythmically, frontwards and/or backwards and/or the head is banged rhythmically/quasi-rhythmically.","The fabricated steel sculpture recreates the dynamic of the machine in the space.

Here you’re apt to see more saris than Spandex on a daily basis. As a larger woman I have been striving, in the face of international foodstuffs, to lose weight for the past five years. Most days I drive to the suburbs to attend a fitness center because we don’t have one in town. Somewhere in all that gym time, I started to see the parallels between working out and making art. There is an undeniable similarity between being in the white-walled space of a gallery and the neutral space of an exercise studio, the daily dedication to the two practices, and the futility and small triumphs that come with both.","My new set of public performances, “It’s Exercise Time!,” are interventions that allow me to use my city, instead of a suburban gym, as my training ground. Dressed in full rainbow-hued regalia, I go through my workout paces at unconventional sites around Hamtramck, tossing sides of meat in Bozek’s meat locker, and lifting a huge bag of onions outside Al Haramain Market. A man in traditional Yemini costume watched me for ten minutes as I attempted to lift the bag over my head. When I finally did, he cried ‘Superhero!’ Though poking fun at my own struggle, they are honest feats of strength.","The in-town workouts resulted in a local gallery show where I was able to build the project as participatory “Jessercise” performances. In this version, I mounted a carpeted platform and led the crowd in instructional workouts with moves like ‘Pop and Squat’—which features a champagne bottle as ‘Hydration Weight’. A sprint around the gallery includes, as its objective, dipping into a bowl of potato chips with every lap. Backsliding is part of the exercise plan. Here the long tradition of displays of endurance in performance art is channeled with a lightness and hilarity that suits the bright palette and self-deprecating humor. Each performance is different, just as exercise routines differ. Each comes with a monologue of my own struggle to fit into my pants as well as fitting into my chosen place. My body, and those of the audience in the gallery become moving sculptures. There is a recalling of the ‘proper’ body image, so ingrained in our culture, replaced instead by an embracing of the everyday and everyone."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"The_Stupor_Sound_Experience.jpg","photo_credit":"Walter Wasacz","title":"THE STUPOR SOUND EXPERIENCE","first_performed":"first performed on October 10, 2015","place":"Elijah’s, Hamtramck, MI","times_performed":"performed twice in 2015","contributor":"STEVE HUGHES","collaborators":["Chris Peters","Nick Cicchetti"],"home":"Hamtramck, MI","links":["stuporzine.com"],"contact":"steve@stuporzine.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"294-295"},"description":["“The Stupor Sound Experience” (TSSE) is an extension of Stupor, my longstanding zine project. As a three-piece noise ensemble, we create a performative context for my stories, most of which I collect from people that I meet at bars here in Hamtramck, Michigan.","In 2015, I began experimenting with the form of my stories by breaking phrases into verse and stanzas. The project resulted in a book-length collection of narrative poems entitled Wasted. The book follows the rise and fall of two heroic alcoholics whose lives are characterized by thirst, desire, and drunken distress. There is an urgency to these narratives. Nothing in them is precious. I had trouble imagining how I might perform the works as poetry. Even the word “poetry” seems foreign to them. Thus, TSSE was born. Plugged in, and turned up, we provide an audio texture to the narratives.","In TSSE, we utilize instruments that have been thrown away. Last year, I found an electric guitar in the alley, sticking out of a garbage can. The fret board was split and separated all down the neck. I clamped it back together and applied some construction adhesive. The tuning pegs are still broken and require a wrench to tighten. The gears slip too. My drum kit is also an alley-find. One of my neighbors who was moving seemed to be throwing away his whole life. Like the characters in Wasted, my instruments are broken and beat up but still have a voice and a story to tell.","TSSE is not a band. We are an experiment in sound. I weave sticks through the strings of my guitar. I hit various parts of its body with drumsticks, then scrape the frets with drywall knives. I start quietly and build intensity, laying out a ragged din of noise that emphasizes the rhythmic structure of my vocals. I pound on the drums then hammer the butt of my guitar against the floor. The sound is filled in by Chris Peters who backs me on guitar. His signal runs through a complex series of effects pedals managed by Nick Cicchetti. The audio component they add is ambient and soaring then harsh with sudden cathartic surges. Together we embrace confusion. We build toward cataclysm. Ultimately, TSSE provides a new visceral framework for the stories in Stupor."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"WHILE_I_WAS_WASHING_THE_DISHES.jpg","photo_credit":"Zierle \u0026 Carter","title":"WHILE I WAS WASHING THE DISHES","first_performed":"first performed on October 10, 2015","place":"Galerie KUB, Leipzig, Germany","times_performed":"performed once in 2015","contributor":"DORIS STEINBICHLER","collaborators":[],"home":"Vienna, Austria","links":[],"contact":"doris.steinbichler@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"296-297"},"description":["With the performance “while I was washing the dishes” I put some colorful splashes onto dogmatic, imperialistic political world views as a statement of dissent.","I contrast live analog visuals and live voice improvisations with a pre-recorded political analysis by Noam Chomsky about the historic reasons of the actual war in Syria.

It is part of my body of work, The Myth of Layla (TMOL), which explores the corruption of an Iranian-American activist’s political ideology through participation in the American media system. TMOL is set in a near future in which the U.S. has declared war with Iran—a fear of mine as an Iranian-American artist—and large media conglomerates have taken over all media channels. While the larger TMOL narrative deals with representation of Middle Easterners in the American media, ASS focuses on the value systems at work in reality television. As Laurie Ouellette states in her book A Companion to Reality Television, “reality television does not just tell stories about processes of lucrative self-production; it materially enacts processes of commodification and promotion by marketing goods, services, and most significantly, people,” or “hybrid ‘person-characters.’” She goes on to say, “here, being is labor and produces value, both for the individual person-characters and for their producers and networks,” or, in the case of ASS, a fictional but omnipotent media network called The Network, and myself as the artist.","In this work, audience members are encouraged to become participants on the show and those that do so become laborers in this value-generation system. All audience members, participants, and non-participants alike, have the opportunity to bear witness to this system in operation, however, participants may realize that they are being commodified for the benefit of The Network and myself as the artist. During the show, challenges are posed and the participants are ostensibly evaluated on their performance. The staging includes areas where cameras record the participants and their responses; the production of an actual television show takes place on stage. Participants find that their will is not entirely free as the outcomes, and occasionally their responses, are determined by a script. In fact, the show’s judges exist as pre-recorded video and will always declare the main character, Layla, the winner. Thus, participation and outcome are not linked; participation, the labor of “being,” serves only to generate value within this system. By choosing to perform ASS as a live, participatory reality show, the audience, by entering the performance space, regardless of whether they participate, is made complicit in both the value-generation system of reality media and the commodification of the participants themselves."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"Good-Food-Responsibility!.jpg","photo_credit":"Rachel Merriman-Goldring","title":"Good?

It takes the receipt out of the wallet and extrapolates part of its physical, historical, social, political, and economic characteristics into parallel existences that disrupt all frames of intelligibility and certitude through parafactual and parafictional approaches.","The need for establishing an institute specialized in this subject matter comes from the lack of attention given to these pieces of paper which represent a core element in perpetuating systems of beliefs, value, and exchange and have a self-contained complicity in the functioning of the world as a whole and in maintaining an undisturbed, fair stream of day-to-day occurrences. Besides, similar to the documentation of live performances and artworks in general, they represent a slippery, reductive record which, most of the time, functions as a replacement of the experience and not as a supplement.","Due to the fact that the Institute is immaterial and does not have a physical working space, “A guided tour of the IIRRE” can happen in any given space and time. By using time-travelling qualities embedded in a specific object named Timbaka, the audience travels back in time to two important moments in the history of the receipt: Ancient Mesopotamia, where the first pieces of writing were discovered in two clay tablets recording the selling of clothing items and domestic animals, and Late Medieval Italy, where the roots of modern banking begin through the replacement of physical money with a written acknowledgement. Then, the audience is brought inside a contemporary thermal printer and it is presented the mechanisms through which a receipt is being produced. Lastly, following a presentation of the latest experiments and findings on the transition from digital to telepathic receipts, the audience receives a telepathic receipt for their visit at the IIRRE.","The specificity of the performance lies in the fact that its whole content is embodied through the use of particular gestures, intonation, body movements, and props as a way to make-believe and imagine.

The 50 minute musical performance juxtaposed Guillaume de Machaut’s seven hundred year old ballade, “Dame, ne regardez pas” with several of Peter Ablinger’s “Instrumente und Rauschen” and premiered Ablinger’s “Kreuze” for solo cello and electronics.","The chronological extremes of Machaut and Ablinger allowed Autoduplicity to question dualities that are often presented as binary poles. Dualities of quiet and loud, low and high, and simple and complex all surfaced and engaged issues of basic audibility.","Autoduplicity arranged six versions of the Machaut ballade that presented it in its barest form and deconstructed it into its most basic elements. The six versions were a common practice arrangement for flute and cello, a pre-recorded and heavily altered tape piece that disembodied the work from the performers, a version during which noise bands of the ballade’s frequency range enveloped the melody as played by the flute and cello, an open score arrangement where fragments of the ballade were performed in spontaneous sequences, an abstract arrangement that distilled the ballade into a microtonal improvisation around the ballade’s central pitch, and a version that removed the ballade’s rhythms to highlight the harmonies of the piece against a sustaining drone.","In the concert, performed without pause, these arrangements of Machaut’s ballade were put into dialogue with many of Peter Ablinger’s Rauschen (noise) pieces. In these pieces bands of noise are used as a tool for audibility or inaudibility. The concert program included “Piccolo und Rauschen,” “WEISS/WEISSLICH 17d: Flöte und Rauschen,” “Das Wirkliche als Vorgestelltes (The Real As Imaginary),” “Kyrie after Machaut,” and the world premiere of “WEISS/WEISSLICH 17k: Violoncello und Rauschen (‘Kreuze’).”","Leaping from the simple purity of Machaut’s single melody to the “everything always” of white noise, Autoduplicity’s “Machaut + Rauschen” explored the hidden complexity in simple sounds and hidden sounds within masses of complex noise. Listening at these extremes revealed how deceptive the very ideas of simple or complex can be by recontextualizing each within the other’s scale and trapping their definitions in infinite loop."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"Vanilla_Utopia.jpg","photo_credit":"Phil McCollam","title":"VANILLA UTOPIA","first_performed":"first performed on November 19, 2015","place":"Sleeth Gallery, Buckhannon, WV","times_performed":"performed once in 2015","contributor":"ELLEN MUELLER","collaborators":[],"home":"Buckhannon, WV","links":["ellenmueller.com"],"contact":"ellen@ellenmueller.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"346-347"},"description":["“Vanilla Utopia” consists of a manual credit card embossing machine and custom-designed pads of paper for collecting participants’ interpretation of the term ‘vanilla utopia’.

But rather than postponing, as many venues did, we decided to go ahead. The small impromptu studio was based on primitive historic models; drapes and curtains, traditional incandescent lights, some props, and attitudes… reminiscent of nomadic studios as one still finds in far-flung places and which used to wander about our itinerant fairground circuits...","Perhaps because of the lockdown some sitters opted for the new fashion of covering your face, everybody beginning to hide behind veils and headdress, balaclavas and bataclans... running around with pixelated faces—except those who are about to detonate... a different kind of blow-up than we considered in the 60s... Yes, even the kids decided democratically not to participate for fear of having themselves displayed on facebook or other unsavoury social media... now that imagery has become so free-for-all, no-one wants it any more... wary of punctuated targeting.","After a careful start the studio warmed up with the presence of friends, passers-by, and curious voyeurs, producing a series of discrete portraits in a predominantly blood-red environment... We had prepared notions on photography, portraiture, performance, and humor on index cards for the sitters to use as inspiration... but most were quite creative enough without prosthetics, thank you.","The second part of the operation was curtailed somewhat by the fact there was no longer a need for a preparatory discussion for the upcoming symposium, and boiled down to a short performative send-off by an improvised samurai (Heinrich Obst) based on Shen Zhou, “On growing a Beard” and a presentation of the photographs taken, after which socializing and banter rounded off the evening, making for a cozy steamy soup kitchen before heading off into the uncertain night."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"Between_Paradise_and_a_Hard_Place.jpg","photo_credit":"Tongyu Zhao","title":"BETWEEN PARADISE AND A HARD PLACE","first_performed":"first performed on November 21, 2015","place":"Links Hall, Chicago, IL","times_performed":"performed once in 2015","contributor":"JOSHI RADIN / MARYAM TAGHAVI","collaborators":[],"home":"Chicago, IL / Tehran, Iran / Toronto, Canada / Vancouver, Canada","links":[],"contact":"joshi@joshiradin.com / mtaghavi@saic.edu","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"354-355"},"description":["Situated between a vision of paradise and an ascetic ideal, we play with tropes and absurdities of the promises of our respective spiritual and religious traditions.

While both traditions have personal resonance for us, they act on different registers of belief, practice, and the body.

Or how to see what is just next to you? Moreover, I was curious how our daily life and routines affect our bodies. Most days we do things; stand in a bus or sit in front of a computer, we have techniques to carry shopping bags and open doors.","I asked four choreographers with different backgrounds to work with me.

The music itself was an energetic mix of non-specific rock, punk, and jazz influences. The heart of the “Bands” concept was embedded in the performance.","The Tenth Intervention trio consisted of violin, piano, and drums. The drummer provided the beats and foundational energy for the performance. The pianist acted as keyboard player, adding little stabs of harmony and performing supportive riffs. The violinist was both lead and rhythm guitar, riding on top of everything else. I acted as both front man and bass player. I did not actually play an instrument but rather used my vintage Nintendo Gameboy to create a bass line and secondary keyboard riffs. I performed my daughter’s words: “Hello, I am not a fairy princess, but I told you so many times that I was a fairy princess…” while the trio pulsed behind me.","It felt great in the performance. The energy was up, the trio was incredible, and the crowd was receptive. It pushed me outside of my comfort zone. I had to practice a lot, saying the words over and over. This is not a piece that would ever have happened (it would never even have occurred to me) without the challenge and opportunity of this particular show.","It was fun to play with various bar band tropes, including a series of instrumental solos in the penultimate section of the piece.

The idea for “RID” came about in part because of the nature of the venue.

I’ve been a dedicated practitioner ever since and use the practice to continue to deconstruct and reconstruct my own identity.

This observation inspired me to expand on the relationship to include more people and experiment with several energies to create a singular identity, even if only temporarily. The public was invited to come “get RID of some sh*t” with me during two back-to-back hour long sessions in the gallery. The timing of the opening was scheduled towards the end of the semester when I knew everyone (myself included) would have built up stress and tension to release. I designed a score specifically aimed to help us get “RID of our sh*t” together. It included tuning in, body warm ups, several meditations, and chanting.

Bloodied and triumphant I am transformed into that ethereal being: The Swan."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"BURNING_WOMAN.jpg","photo_credit":"Nina Isabelle","title":"BURNING WOMAN","first_performed":"first performed on December 19, 2015","place":"Rosekill, Rosendale, New York","times_performed":"performed once in 2015","contributor":"FEMINIST ART GROUP","collaborators":[],"home":"Brooklyn, NY","links":[],"contact":"feministartgroup@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"376-377"},"description":["Built a structure using surrounding natural materials from the Rosekill, NY landscape. The natural debris was the source for the construction held together by hammering nails into the wood. There was a request from Jill McDermind of Grace Exhibition Space and Rosekill to build a burning woman installation for the Winter Solstice. This idea was generated by Adriana Magaña of the 90s band Crash Worship. The result was the construction of a collectively made sculpture and one large figure to ‘burn.’ The image is of the build and the result was one large 20 ft structure with a Juniper root head engulfed in flames.","For us the building of the structure was the performance. We created video vignettes of the building process. Artists gathering materials loading and unloading abstract actions, gestures, and decisions that directly affected the result of the sculpture. These actions also evolved the work into something different. We had no specific plan of what the object would look like. The Feminist Art Group style of performance is task based. We create a task and execute it, which often involves constructing or de-constructing objects while different artists are curated into the work which leads to different results. Our work centers around building as performative action with Feminist bodies."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"A_PRESENT.jpg","photo_credit":"William Skaleski","title":"A PRESENT","first_performed":"first performed on December 21, 2015","place":"Artist’s studio, Milwaukee, WI","times_performed":"performed once in 2015","contributor":"WILLIAM SKALESKI","collaborators":[],"home":"Milwaukee, WI","links":["vimeo.com/williamskaleski"],"contact":"williamskaleski@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"378-379"},"description":["I made this performance as a birthday present for a friend I made this year. She had highly expressed her interest in my past work on our first hangout together. Not many of my close friends have shown this much curiosity in my work so I made a special performance in which I represented my feelings for my friend, as a sort of a prayer, to tell her ‘thank you’ for wanting to be interested in something that involved expressing myself in my purest and most honest way. The piece is mostly an abstract stream of consciousness of my thoughts and feelings towards my new friend. The actual performance movements don’t have specific meaning but are more of a spontaneous interpretation of my feelings for her at the time. In the past, I have gotten compliments about the passion I have for my work, but having someone outside of my ‘art circle’—in the same place I was when I first discovered performance art—complimenting me on my work meant even more to me. It was as if—through her—I was able to see the full circle in which I had come; at first being someone who didn’t know anything about the concept of visual performance to becoming an artist that could touch someone. There’s also the fact that we might have a relationship that expands past being just ‘friends’ and the thought that my passion for art has contributed to that makes me proud to be part of the art community."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2015","image":"SENSE'S_CENSUS.jpg","photo_credit":"Larkin Higgins","title":"SENSE’S CENSUS","first_performed":"first performed on December 31, 2015","place":"El Marino Park, Culver City, CA","times_performed":"performed once in 2015","contributor":"LARKIN HIGGINS","collaborators":[],"home":"Los Angeles, CA","links":[],"contact":"wordimage2@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"380-381"},"description":["For many artists/writers, research is necessary to comprehend exactly what the government regards as having value or constitutes a necessary expense for one’s listed occupation on income tax forms... or what qualifies as a deduction.","Instead of the usual solitary ritual of sifting through a year’s worth of goods and services, I embarked on a performance intended to move this private act (performed at home) to a public place (a city park).
