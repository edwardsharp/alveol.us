In “montage” the user takes a different role within the ‘spectator’ role, its reflection happens after its presence; the artist is activated and present in memory actions distant in different times; the space—universe—is addressed in real time and the final ‘montage’ is a temporal capsule of different temporal spasms convened in the same place.

“montage” is part of my project TRANSCODING, a project that aims at investigating the intersection between human and technology and commenting on the shift provoked by a massive incorporation of communication technologies both in the physical and digital spheres.
