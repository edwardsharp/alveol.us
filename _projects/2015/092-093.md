“Mrs. Babinski in the Kitchen” was an exploration in genre mixing. We were mostly interested in obscuring the traditional musical comedy formula (the characters were the band and the songs were lyrical as opposed to plot progressive, creating more of an atmosphere with the music rather than exposing the characters' innermost thoughts) but we also played with mixing absurdism with hyper realistic dialogue and fairy tale fantasy with modern technology.

“Mrs. Babinski in the Kitchen” moves through time backwards from spring (A Friendship) to winter (A Love Story) to fall (An Ending), each season a different world within itself. It follows the story of an old huntress who was rudely awakened by curious animal children after a 100 year nap and her struggle to remember how she fell asleep on the kitchen floor. What follows is a nostalgic exploration of a lost friendship filled with trips to the beach in the night, obese murderers living upstairs, and the murder of some friends. “Babinski” seeks to capture the journey of a modern relationship by taking us as far away from reality as possible.
