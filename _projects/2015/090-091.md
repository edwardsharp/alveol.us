Through the figure of the Minotaur, Paulo Aureliano da Mata evaluates the sex-negativity of certain areas of his body and the vestment as an artifact connected to prudency, even when he uses the vestment to improperly adorn his body and when he sutures clothing on micro parts of the small Minotaur body tattooed on his right forearm.

The video performance only shows the undressing of the image, the undoing of the sutures that symbolically (and literally) hurt his skin. This work relates to his series of Minotaurs realized between 2010 and 2015.
