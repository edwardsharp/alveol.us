The “Plant Rescue & Rehabilitation Center” is a rehabilitation center for neglected vegetation across the desert that is the San Diego metropolitan area. I’m interested in what can be gleaned from de-centering the human in design. I am locating the affective qualities of biopolitics as they are produced under urban choreography concerned with various scales and resolution of administering life. I scout quiet San Diego neighborhoods for hangers-on, stealing neglected plants from backyards, porches, sidewalks, and trash dumps.

This is a micro scale, landscape architecture performance whereas these models (or concept images) could act as resistance to the visual coherence of the state in the urban landscape. This work arose out of an attention to complex human and non-human relationships that can be translated into something illegible and incomprehensible to the state. While this work may seem inconsequential, it is my attention to support overlooked forms of life against neglect.
