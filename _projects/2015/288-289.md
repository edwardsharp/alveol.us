PF: QUINQ was a conference of performance situations October 8–October 25, 2015. Through performance of the conference, we collectively theorized forms of organization for, and realization of, diversely theoretical performance practices. Forms and terms were constructed by participants and organizers in adaptation to temporary and situational presences and processes (as conferred).

Organization was performed in layers:

LAYER 1: Performed as a sequence of diagram-interviews online and in person by Esther Neff and Brian McCorkle for TAR Magazine and the Curating Performance as Artistic Practice conference (held by Association of Performance Art, Berlin). Twelve “agendas” were synthesized from results of these diagram-interviews (panoplylab.org/research/displaydiagrams.html)

LAYER 2: An open call invited participations to submit “abstracts” in reaction and relation to the twelve agendas. These abstracts were published online (panoplylab.org/quinquennial/) and used to schedule the twelve days of the conference.

LAYER 3: Live performances, presentations, actions, lectures, discussions, durational and social works, experiments, and other projects were publicly presented Thursday through Sunday for three weekends in a row.

Conferring participants included:

Adriana Disman, Alex Romania, Alice Vogler and Jessica Gath, Amanda Hunt, Angela Freiberger, Angeli + Michael Sloan Warren, Anja Morell, Anya Liftig, Baxton Alexander, Ben Bennett, Bobby English Jr, Britta Wheeler, Butch Merigoni, Christen Clifford, Chun Hua Catherine Dong, Mona Chromatic (Daniel Larkin), David Ian Griess, Dolly Dharma, Édgar Javier Ulloa Luján & Laura Blüer, Emily Oliviera, Emma-Kate Guimond, Esther Neff, Fauziya Sani, Florence Nasar, Grace Exhibition Space (Jill McDermid and Erik Hokanson), Hector Canonge, Hiroshi Shafer, Hoesy Corona, Honey McMoney, Hyperallergic, Ian DeLeon + AGROFEMME (+ curation: Màirèad Delaney, Heidi Wiren Bartlett & Esther Baker-Tarpaga, Madge of Honor), Ivy Castellanos, Jenna Kline, Jon Konkol, Julia Croft/Future Husband, Kaia Gilje, Kerry Cox, Kikuko Tanaka, Leili Huzaibah (curation: Chaw Ei Thein, Shizu Homma, Helen Hawley, Nooshin Rostami), LJ Leach, Lorene Bouboushian, Marcelline Mandeng, Matthew Gantt, Meli Sanfiorenzo, Michael Newton, Naked Roots Conducive, Nathaniel Sullivan, Nicole Brydson, Quinn Dukes, Rae Goodwin, Raki Malhotra, Rebecca Beauchamp, DIVERSITY FELLOWS!, Robert Lisek, Shawn Escarciga, Soufïa Bensaïd, Sura Hertzberg, Tatyana Tennenbaum/Marisa V.
