“song of myself or (m)other” is about a mother and her daughter. It revolves around otherness, being different as a distinction or devaluation, and holding your own at the start of adulthood and in the working world. It raises questions about the individual’s need for protection in the collective, about equal rights for people with disabilities, and about the care expected from the state and one’s family.

Felicitas’ wish and talent to perform was the first reason to present this work. The performance is accompanied by a philosopher whose words are simultaneously translated into plain language by a translator, both of whom are part of the audience. We use the entrance, the stage as well as the backstage, the wardrobes, and the street outside as spaces for storytelling, performance, interactions, and installations. Intended to be an ongoing performance into the future, “song of myself or (m)other” is intended to show each year’s “status quo,” a performative description of our present situation, always in different surroundings and different formats.
