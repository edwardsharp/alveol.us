“Watch Me Trust Myself” (2015) was a performative gesture rejecting the glorified isolation and poverty of the emerging writer as well as the invisibility of the black female academic. The performance comprised a manuscript written in a Google Document shared with audience members who had purchased access to said Document via a sliding scale PayPal payment. Audience members (both potential and actual) were continually apprised of the performance via posts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
