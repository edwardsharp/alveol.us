“Inner performances” is a series of actions that encourage audience participation. We use a soft floor as the scene. The performance is silent.

We remove the external perception of the audience by having them wear glasses with printed eyes which blur their vision. We then lift viewers off the ground and arrange them in such a way with the other viewers that they can remain in a supported inclined position while we jog and give handshakes without changing our places within space. During the interim actions, texts—designed to undermine relations between subject and object—are read aloud.

With combinations of parallel and consecutive actions, “Inner Performances” in the minds of viewers are created—a form of thinking with no object, beyond 
power relations.
