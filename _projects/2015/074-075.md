Drawing on earlier performances and actions, “A Portrait of Friends” seeks to explore the relationship between various versions of self. Actions performed included voiding my face with fabric, distorting a projected imaged with two glasses of water, and wearing a red, women’s nightgown (performing as “Claire”). This is the first performance where I directly explore queer identity/gender fluidity. Though this is a new concept I am working with, this piece continues my exploration into mortality and chronic illness. In a final action, I remove my shoes and slide them over the two glasses of water. I pick them up, and turn them upside down. After a moment, the water from the glasses begins to seep through the fabric of the canvas shoes. The performance ends when all of the water has left the glasses and shoes.
