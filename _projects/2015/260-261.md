The piece “Sad Superman” is based off of a child’s drawing found while riding a bus on the way to a breast cancer walk for a friend who has now passed away; ‘what child would draw a Sad Superman.’

In the performance the artist IV was flown in by five colleagues while wearing a garbage bag cape and four rolls of tape; two on each wrist. IV was lowered to the ground and the tape was pulled from the rolls. IV’s body was pulled between the five colleagues over the stage and eventually IV broke free, destroyed all of the trash bags and left.

The piece was performed at the Abrons Art Center for the Queer Performance Festival. One main component of the piece was that in the collective that performed for the evening event, IV was the only queer artist who performed. Being flown in as Superman to hold the weight of the collective as the representation of queer.
