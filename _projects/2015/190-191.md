“This Bridge Called My Back or the never ending labor of creating space to move past the isms” is a four hour durational performance and installation that examines the intersections of oppression.

For the performance, the artist formed two white sculptural pyramids with rice and sugar, the primary products of 19th century slave labor. After forming these mounds, the artist read verses from the old testament of the bible, alluding to the spiritual method through which slaves, and then sharecroppers, used to transcend the oppressive social-economic structures they were bound to within American society. The final portion of the performance score includes the artist making a bridge with their body and two chairs, like a sculpture, for a period of 30 minutes.
