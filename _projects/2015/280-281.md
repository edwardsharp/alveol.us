“Letters to Imaginary Friends” was an epistolary performance piece that explored how much real value can lie in beings that we all agree to be unreal. For one month, I spent nearly every day in a ground-floor gallery penning letters to figments of my imagination, and inviting the surrounding community to contribute to the project by drawing portraits of these unreal characters. The letters were honest, sincere and completely improvised, always written directly to one of five imaginary friends (Gogo, Weeyam, Jofusina, Boris and Heeper-Keesh). In a sense, my audience was experiencing one side of five distinct intimate dialogues, and then asked to use their imaginative abilities to draw the other side.
