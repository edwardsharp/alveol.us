“Edit Sessions” is a series of durational performances in which the videographer acting as performer makes available for use by a participating audience-editor, her video tape archive of footage spanning a ten year period (1999-2009). The footage in this video tape archive includes vignettes documenting aspects of personal everyday-life, material shot of past projects, and video documentation of other people’s performances and activities.

After semi-arbitrarily selecting footage from the video archive, the audience-editor has a predetermined set of time to parse through their selected material, taking note of the segments they are personally interested in including in the creation of a three minute video piece. For the audience-editor, the first part of the session involves sifting through the selected material and maybe taking notes. The second part of the session involves the videographer digitizing and editing the selected footage according to the audience-editor’s directions using the editing program Final Cut Pro.
