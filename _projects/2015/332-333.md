Performance:

At the gallery entrance announce, “I’m not here for the money, I’m here for the exposure.”

{In hand, a tied scroll.}

Insert six one-euro coins into mouth, one at a time, punctuating each insertion with, “I’m not here for the money, I’m here for the exposure.”

Remove three shirts, punctuating each removal with, “I’m not here for the money, I’m here for the exposure.”

On the final announcement, dropping pants around ankles to bare ass skin.

Hobble down three steps into gallery.

Kneel on floor.

Untie scroll.

Floss teeth hard with tie.

Slobber out bloody coins onto scroll.

Remain drooling.

Rise and hobble up steps and out of gallery.

Take your time.

Thought:

A jab at administrated institutionalized insistence on the blind eye towards the need for artists to get paid, while simultaneously benefitting financially from all the the free labor of artists. Why does only the director get paid?
