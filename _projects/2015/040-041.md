This performance occurred as a part of research I was doing about small architectural structures/bodies that interact with the human body in public spaces. For my research, a performance was a necessary next step. The purpose of “Subtle Horizon” was to create a question or reflection about the purpose a human being has by living in a place.

The performance was two days long, and it consisted of a long walk around the city with a pink shape on my head. I was behaving as if it was normal. I went shopping, rode on the tram, walked in the street and in the park, etc., with the only difference being that it was impossible for me to see the horizon.
