With the performance “while I was washing the dishes” I put some colorful splashes onto dogmatic, imperialistic political world views as a statement of dissent.

I contrast live analog visuals and live voice improvisations with a pre-recorded political analysis by Noam Chomsky about the historic reasons of the actual war in Syria. My voice is distorted and I am creaking, crackling, chuckling, clucking, fizzling, hissing, wheezing, whining, panting, giggling, gagging, gargling, gasping, groaning, grunting, tittering, purring, soughing, swooshing, squeaking, susurrating, snorting, snuffling, sniffing, snooping, and screaming.

The visuals are done with three overhead projectors and kitchen appliances. Cake plates turn into bizarre monsters, crystal salad bowls show their second face as psychedelic rhythm machines and rubber floor mats spin on cheese trays.

This is my feminist empowerment strategy confronting manipulative information.
