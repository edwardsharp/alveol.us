One day the Venezuelan performance artists Julian Higuerey, Aidana Rico, and Ignacio Pérez decided to make a Performance Art Strike as a protest against the deprofessionalization of Venezuelan performance art. Wearing t-shirts that read “On strike for performance art” and signs with phrases like “I think, then do performance,” “This is not a performance,” and “Who cares about a performance art strike?,” they walked in circles around a public square in Caracas, Venezuela. During three hours, people that passed didn’t know what was happening, wondering, “What the fuck is performance?” That was the only disruption that happened that day, there was no change in reality; a lot of Venezuelan performance artists keep doing regular and bad works and performance art organizers still don’t take their events seriously. Since that day, these artists decided to extend the strike indefinitely and call for performance artists everywhere in the world to join the protest.
