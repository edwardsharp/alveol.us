The performance is a harmonized Muslim call to prayer (adhaan). It was recorded at a friend’s studio. Where I come from, various mosques of different Muslim sects give their adhaans at different times, in different keys and styles. What ensues is a cacophony of sound that has deeply upset me since I was a child. I have harmonized the azaan and set it against the backdrop of a futuristic landscape to imagine what a consolidated call to prayer might sound like. I can’t actually perform this piece live because I could get killed.
