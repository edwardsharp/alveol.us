“Vanilla Utopia” consists of a manual credit card embossing machine and custom-designed pads of paper for collecting participants’ interpretation of the term ‘vanilla utopia’. While dressed in a white suit, I punch participants’ interpretations into blank white credit cards and display them on white shelves designed to hold a single card each. These cards form a wall of ‘vanilla utopias’ and will be cataloged in an artist book.
