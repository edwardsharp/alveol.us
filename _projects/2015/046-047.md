“JARMAN (ALL THIS MADDENING BEAUTY)” is a performative gesture inspired by iconic queer artist, filmmaker, and gardener Derek Jarman. Temporal orientations arise and fall away as one performer in space traces the origins of Derek Jarman’s brilliant queerness. Merging landscapes of text, video, and live performance, JARMAN orientates itself to both present and past, gazing upon the icon through imagined territories and constructed spaces, making room for the possibility of a conversation across time. Performed by force/collision’s Founding Director John Moletress, with a text by Obie Lifetime Achievement Award-winning playwright Caridad Svich, JARMAN is a transatlantic flight through memory and time.
