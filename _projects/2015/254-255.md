Situated on the Nathan Phillips Square event stage, “Portrait of a Timekeeper” tests the limits of the human body in the face of relentless punctuality. In the absence of a public clock at the current Toronto City Hall, DiCarlo performs an endurance-based test to manually keep time for the duration of their annual art fair, transforming the stage into a functional site of temporal measurement. Through repetition and inevitable human error, DiCarlo struggles to calibrate her internal clock with Old City Hall’s clock tower chimes; using repurposed bells to express fifteen minute marked intervals, resulting in a cacophonic duet over a 24 hour time period.
