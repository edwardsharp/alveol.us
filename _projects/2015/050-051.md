“O” is a cycle of transformation. It is a performance practice based on embryonic human development, following the work of Isabelle Schad that comes from the Body Mind Centering somatic practice done by Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen. I expanded this practice by incorporating the concept of relational objects from Brazilian artist Lygia Clark. Throughout “O” the performers travel through different physical and mental states, maintaining a relation between each other, with a fabric-made kind of pupa that allows them to incorporate different movement patterns (coming from the study of the embryo development). The fabric between them also work as an interface between the performers that plays with textures, colors, shapes, and non-shapes. “O” was created as both a practice and a choreography of textures, although it differs from traditional choreography in that it allows each performer´s body to express an authentic movement within the patterns. The embryo experience is a common experience to all humans, so the practice is designed to relate to every kind of body.
