“Winter is Hereby Cancelled (Herved er vinteren avlyst)” was a situationist intervention in the progress of the seasons. Leaves were collected from the ground beneath an oak tree and suspended between the branches and the ground on linen threads.

It was part of an exhibition of site-specific work in a Norwegian forest. The opening event of the exhibition took place at the point of transition between autumn and winter, just as the leaves began to fall. The performance took place through the day until the fading of light made it impossible for the performer to continue enacting this literal-minded refusal of the classic signal of the coming of winter.
