## EmergencyINDEX

## ðŸš¨ â†¬ moved to [github.com/emergencyindex/emergencyindex.com](https://github.com/emergencyindex/emergencyindex.com)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/edwardsharp/alveol.us/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for this website in Markdown files.

Whenever someone commits to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the site (_limit of 10 builds an hour_). 

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling text. It includes conventions for general purpose formatting, for example:

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Project template

All of the project files need to include this [YAML](http://yaml.org/) metadata at the top of the Markdown file:

```markdown
